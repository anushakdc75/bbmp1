reddit,"have you ever been able to get something done(sanitation, roads) by your local municipal body by raising issues online? if yes, which city do you live in? i know bangalore had a pothole app but that's that. i recently moved back to my hometown from bangalore. i find the roads, sanitation extremely poor (in visakhapatnam, supposedly 10th largest city by gdp) . i found out about a few helplines that i can call to raise this issue with local municipal bodies but there was little to no response (accountability).

my question really is whether there is a way to collectively ask these municipal bodies about what we care about and have an accountable way for tracking the concerned issue. what is your experience with your local municipal bodies?",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"traffic jam thoughts - maybe we're more blessed than we think? stuck in silk board traffic for the millionth time today and was getting super frustrated. then randomly remembered something i read about counting your blessings vs complaints.

it broke things down into three categories:

* natural stuff (clean air, water, weather)
* daily cycles (day/night, seasons)
* everything else we need to survive

and ended with ""humans are never satisfied no matter what they have.""

made me think about bangalore differently while sitting there honking at nothing:

yeah, traffic sucks. weather's unpredictable. rent is insane. but also... we have:

* jobs that pay well enough to afford cars/bikes
* metro expanding (finally!)
* amazing food scene - from ctr dosas to truffles
* decent hospitals, schools, infrastructure
* cool weather most of the year (when it's not raining for 3 days straight)
* tech ecosystem where you can literally build a startup
* pubs, malls, parks when you need to unwind

the reading said if you actually tried to list everything good around you, you'd never finish. but humans just focus on problems.

guilty as charged. i complain about bmtc buses but use them daily. curse bescom but have 24/7 power (mostly). hate zomato delivery charges but order dinner anyway.

not saying we shouldn't demand better roads or governance. just wondering if we bangaloreans are a bit too pessimistic sometimes?

anyone else think we take the good parts of namma bengaluru for granted? or am i just being too optimistic after too much filter coffee? ☕",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"india’s local governance is a mess. here’s how we can fix it i’ve been thinking a lot about how unnecessarily complicated india’s governance structure is. we have districts, tehsils, blocks, mandals, panchayats, municipalities, and municipal corporations, all overlapping and creating a bureaucratic nightmare. who is responsible for what? no one knows. this system was created from colonial times, and it needs to be reformed

**the problem**

* a district has its own commissioner, medical officer, fire service, etc. but at the same time, multiple districts can overlap with a municipality.
* rural areas are even worse – a single village has to deal with a gram panchayat, a block officer, a tehsil officer, and the district administration, all at the same time.
* big cities are just as bad. eg: the bmc in mumbai handles roads and waste, the state government controls transport and policing, and district officers manage revenue. too many departments, zero accountability.

**the solution: a simple, three-tier system-**

instead of having so many overlapping layers, why not just have three clear levels?

1. central government – handles national issues like defense, foreign policy, taxation, and inter-state matters.
2. state government – responsible for state policing, healthcare, education, and state-level infrastructure.
3. local government-

a) municipal corporations (big cities) – fully autonomous, handling transport, housing, waste, water, policing, and taxation.

b) municipalities (small towns) – similar to municipal corporations but on a smaller scale.

c) district governments (for rural areas) – one elected district government replaces blocks, tehsils, and panchayats, handling healthcare, schools, roads, sanitation, and economic development.

**funding for local governments-**

one of the biggest problems in india is that local governments don’t have financial independence. they rely on states for funding. that's why there a should a new finance bill that states the following:

1. 10% of the central government’s gross tax revenue should go as devolution to local governments.
2. 35% of the central government’s gross tax revenue should go as devolution to state governments.
3. 25% of a state’s own tax revenue should go as devolution to local governments within that state.

this would ensure that local governments have guaranteed funding and won't have to rely on the state or center for grants. this would also give the local governments financial autonomy

**outcomes-**

1. more accountability – if something isn’t working in your city or district, you know exactly who is responsible.
2. less corruption &amp; wastage – removing unnecessary layers will save billions of rupees every year.
3. faster decision-making – no more endless approvals from multiple departments.
4. better local services – cities and districts get direct funding, improving governance.

**how can this be implemented-**

1. pilot projects in 1-2 states – merge tehsils, blocks, and panchayats into district governments and see how it works.
2. amend the constitution – modify 73rd &amp; 74th amendments to officially restructure local governance.
3. expand nationwide in phases – implement it gradually over 5-10 years.

**note-**

most countries don’t have this many administrative layers. this confusing system in india only creates inefficiency, confusion, and corruption. for eg: us only has federal, state, county/municipal governments

what do you think? would this system be better? is it possible to push for such a reform?",PseudoTopic_0

a fraud is using my vehicle numberplate and raking up a lot of fines. we informed the cops in december and they asked us not to pay those fines and said they have sent an alert message but they haven't taken any action yet.

there is another major problem. we had an existing icici fastag and the fraud brought a hdfc fasttag either with fake documents or no documents. icici bank closed our fasttag without informing us. but, hdfc is not willing to close the frauds fastag without informing him. and they are unable to contact him. we have submitted an official letter from the cops and all the vehicle documents and they are not taking any action. we are unable to travel on toll roads without taking a hit on our wallets.

please advise what steps we can take to get this issue fixed.

reddit,"don't take life for granted well i want to share my life story till now

sharing you my story till now fyi - i am a guy

birth to 2 years old - i was born prematurely at 5 months , from what my mom said drs said you can take him home  but he won't live.
according to my mom she fought day &amp; night to well save me...

2 years to 12 - in these time there was no health issues that i know of. i was a trouble maker like i would climb under construction building 3 stories high just to fly a kite. my father got extremely rich during this time,and overall time was good untill the end of my 12th birthday when my father got a drinking problem.

12-14years - my father used to come late everynight  and my mom &amp; me couldn't sleep almost every night.
he began losing his wealth and his mind too. he left his job and intentionally destroyed our whole family savings. he got diagnosed with liver failure by then for some reason he was sober these , i remember myself telling to him to live for my sake he said it's too late , he died a month later

14-20 years - with my father dead and only my mom's last 3 lakh rs, she put it on mis for a princely monthly income of rs 1400, we would eat potato curry and rice on maximum days in a month baring a few in some days when my grandfather came and brould something good. in this time i would buy a old computer to learn it.
begged my mom to give me internet she did give me but the net was of local cable of rs 150/month 100 hours a month 15 kbps,🤣🤣🤣. this time i learned pc hardware repair from web articles, and i started earning something and paid for my own college and also at home, bought a mobile.

20-25years - joined a company that seemed okay , salary was increasing my mom and me used to eat good food everyday and i bought an ac for her money was in bank , mom was pestering me to get married good times.

26-28 years got married my mom was happy but i was not as my current wife cannot tolerate sex pain🤣🤣🤣

28- 33 years i get neck pain now and then so i got and mri and wouldn't you know it they found a rare malformation on my neck and brain area which was critical. reffered me to a neurosurgeon, he said to get immediate surgery or risk being paraplegic but i didn't have any symptoms dr said in this case their is no symptoms only effect. so  i arranged funds as my sweet employer didn't even enroll me to any health plans like esi he did have that but didn't give to me , he said"" you are so bubbly  never thought you would have health issues"" so i managed funds and i got the surgery...and i am thinking when will i lose bodily function  as the failure rate of this surgery is high.
i got into depression and the happiness is gone of all things my employer would just withhold my salary everymonth for me to state how much i have worked.
i was going to work with a neckbrace everyday and there would be days where he would scheme me to stand 4-5 hours which would cause me pain.
got many other job offers but relative said don't take as you are sort of handicapped and can't work anywhere, to them my great employer is god 

my wife has started their typical "" my life is ruined from the day i married you almost everyday now.

33 to corona- at holi my mom was complaining of abdominal pain so took her to hospital , dr said both her kidneys have failed she will go soon, couldn't believe it as whe was ok no complains the day i took her to hospital she only cooked for for the day...my unds were almost finished took her to a govt hospital and she too died. my life was blank from this point on as i thought nothing can happen to my iron lady my mother.


corona period - well my godly employer decided to terminate just my job in the whole office

after my mom is gone my wife and i used to have regular fights about not having a baby, i told her how is it my fault when can't tolerate sex....she said if you were a man i would be pregnant 🤣🤣🤣🤣

2022 till now - i was adamant to try for a baby so i began our journey of ivf fertility clinics. money was spent like water in the pursuit of parental happiness,
deep inside i felt like worst is coming for me so get that baby out soon🤣🤣🤣. after spending almost a fortune
the doctor said she is out of embryos and after this many trials chance of conceiving are low. she said there is new procedure to try but it would cost close to 10 lacs
i said i don't have the money she said she could arrange 
emi financing, as husband &amp; wife we were beyond broken almost on the brink of divorce.
then one day she said she missed her period, i didn't bother thought it was a fluke as before but after 10 days i did the pee test, it was positive for pregnancy. god has finally listened to us. i immediately changed drs and i made it my target to bring the baby home as i knew this was my only chance. after a roller coster ride the time came and her water broke and my baby was to be delivered 2 weeks early. i finnally welcomed my daughter in this world and the day was like dream of dreams.
i was living the perfect life thinking about her future schools and other things.

few months ago i went to my doctor to tell him to give me a usg to see the status of my fatty liver, i was confident of fatty liver stage decrease as i controlled on foods, he said you are paranoid go enjoy your life your are totally fit but i insisted on it.

so the day of the usg i will never forget the person doing the usg was scolding me that why do people like me do not do regular scans, i said if there is anything wrong he said report will be there.

on the report there is a liver mass and kidney mass, i immediately took that to my dr he said he suspects malignancy so get a ct.

i did a ct and the tumor on liver was benign but the kidney one is cancer. 
i did the surgery which was required but i have not been the same , i don't go to office , lost my focus in life, eating out my savings...i have no confidence on future

this is a true story of mine thanks for reading ...",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"is there any negative stereotype that indians still haven't hit yet? as an indian, it's so sad and depressing to see all the negative stereotypes against indians. unfortunately, majority of them are true. it's a pretty shame we have more negative stereotypes than any other country. some of the worst i've come across are scam callers, terrible smelly people, unhygienic food makers and eaters, creepy weird pervert online, rapists men, unclean filthy streets and garbage everywhere, street poopers, cow piss drinkers, etc. and the list will still go.

i really don't think any other country or race have this much of negative stereotypes. i think, we gotta admit and acknowledge most of them are true and try to educate our fellow citizens. india really has to improve a lot when it comes to civic sense. we must break these stereotypes and try to avoid such non-sense in future. man, looking at the number of these stereotypes, i'm even scared to go out of this country bcos of how foreigners will treat me knowing that i'm an indian. recently, there has been a massive large number of hateful posts against india and indian people because of these stereotypes.

reddit,"terrible experience at sbi so here's the entertaining story of my adventure at sbi. i knew their service is shit, but i was determined to go to the bank to do this: close my account. i had an old bank account at sbi from my college time and i wanted to officially close it because i wasn't using it. i have moved back to my hometown after graduating. i knew there would be some home branch drama involved so i prepared myself for it.

i went to the local branch and gave them my story. as i braced for forms to be filled out, the lady (who looked like a classic sbi aunty btw) told me to send an email to the home branch! i was pleasantly surprised! closing bank account can be done with email!? much wow. unfortunately she did give me a form and asked me to fill it, scan it and send it. fair enough. looks like it's just one form. basic details had to be filled out. went home, filled it, scanned it, and sent it. done and dusted. i wait for a week and send a reminder and ask them to respond.

no response. much wow. 

i knew sbi has a directory where they can call other branches and shit. so i went back to the local branch, went to the same lady. the wise old goldfish on her table told me that she forgets everything so i had to tell her the whole story all over again. so i tell her, emphasizing that she was the one who asked me to send the email. i tell her there has been no response over a month. she looks up her directory and gives me the phone number of the branch manager of that home branch. i can call and get shit done? much wow. 

i go home and call the number. he tells me he hasn't seen the mail and asks me to send me the account number and stuff on whatsapp. i send it over. and wait for some more weeks. i call him up again, and he says he can't do it. umm wtf? he says he'll transfer the account to the local branch so i can get it closed at the local branch. he asks me for ifsc. sbi addresses are not really descriptive so i couldn't figure out the ifsc online. looks like there's another trip to the lady that remembers everything.

i go to the branch and she isn't there. expecting her to be at lunch, i ask her colleagues. they say she's on leave. much wow. i caught hold of someone else and told them the story and they gave me ifsc. yay! yay?

i call you the home branch manager again and give him the ifsc thinking it'll take another month or so to get transferred, but voila! it's transferred immediately. transferring the account was faster than writing deep learning models in rust.

anyhoo, i go to the branch thinking it'll be my last visit. meet the lady. this time i just start narrating the story from the top lol without expecting her to remember anything. she listens without getting pissed, thankfully, and then i get to the bit where i transferred the account to this branch. so local branch is home branch yay! she asks me why. i say that branch manager refused to close it. and she erupts. she starts hounding me and asking me why i couldn't close it, like it was somehow my fault. i had to remind her that i'm not an employee at sbi (but a certain being i'm talking to might be powerful enough to solve the mystery of why the branch manager refused. alas, the being was unaware of their prowess) and that i was merely the peasant who held an account at sbi. she's then appears confused. i was worried i might have to tell my story all over again (the goldfish told me to be patient). 

then there is some back and forth where i emphasize that i simply want the account closed. she discusses this with her colleague and tells me that i need to do re-kyc. umm what's that? another form? yes another form. ok, is this the last mile? hopefully. i agree to do re-kyc. i need to produce some documents and it'll be done. i can then close the account. 

but hold on lol. she tells me that i need to wait 3 months before i can close the account. umm why? it's because re-kyc is done. so i gotta fill out this re-kyc first and then wait 3 months. 

yeah? fuck that. i took my money out and let the account rot. i was doing them a favour by telling them i want to close the account and the bitch acts like she's doing me a favour by letting me close the account. 

i went icici to close another account of mine. lady asks if i'm sure. i was prepared for more nonsense. i answered in the affirmative. she takes my card, cuts it, asks me to sign, asks for a bank account to transfer the proceeds to, and done! that was like 5 min. seriously fuck sbi.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"how should the indians stand against the injustice of the govt. there are lot disturbing events happening in india like the cutting down of aravalli hills, the aqi issue, corruption and a lot more. what govt and supreme court is doing instead of stopping this or taking action against it. they are making baseless comments like for aqi, there is no direct link between air pollution and lung disease. when cm of delhi was asked about the spraying of water near aqi measurement station she says its like temperature, spraying water is the only solution and govt changing the from global standards to its own for aqi instead of addressing the problem and taking measures to solve it.

the cutting down of aravalli is another major case- modi has given aravalli hills to adani for mining, supreme court changes the definition of hill, just so that they can cut down the aravalli hills, it will be major blow for the ecosystem of the northern region, there are protests going on and govt is giving a blind eye to it.

there are many issues like corruption, lack of education, the rupee collapse, unemployment, poverty and yet the the parliament is discussing vande mataram train.

under modi and bjp rule the supreme court a independent judiciary body has become the puppet of the govt, govt is doing what they want, filling the pockets of indian billionaires and their own and nobody is there to stop them. when rahul gandhi exposed the election scam the govt used the election commission to shut him down. we aren't living in democratic india anymore, it is a pure dictatorship of modi and bjp government.

if this goes on and we keep quite the india will be doomed in upcoming years from all aspects financial, economical and environmentally.

its the responsibility of indian youth to stand against such government like the youth of nepal and indonesia. i'm not suggesting the youth should start protesting but we need to figure out a way to put an end to all of this, we can't just sit back.",PseudoTopic_0

1. apply for new fast-tag that takes 7-8 days.

2. cancel the fast-tag and apply through new bank. cancellation takes 7-8 days.

3. get it replaced through agent - who's locations are not fixed and are ""generally available"" near toll plaza. i went near the toll plaza, there were none from kotak. 

i know that the toll plaza can get it deducted from number plate, but not all toll plaza have this and have to pay double. also the moment you stop to tell them to initiate the deduction from number plate, the people on the back are not even ready to wait few seconds and will honk like there life is on the line. i have to leave urgently due to some work. we will see if we can find some agents roaming around.

reddit,"kadubeesanahalli to doddakannelli road — is it ever getting fixed? the stretch from kadubeesanahalli to doddakannelli has to be one of the dustiest, dirtiest roads in bangalore. it’s full of huge potholes, and when it rains, those turn into massive puddles.

the drainage was blocked for days, and when repair work finally started, they dug everything up and dumped all the muck on the already filthy footpath. that path is now just a mix of dirt, dust, and obstacles.

to make matters worse, the aet junction on this route is a traffic nightmare — it takes forever to get through. walking here feels like going through a dust tornado, and i can’t imagine how much we’re inhaling daily. the footpaths are crooked, taken over by street vendors or parked delivery bikes, so pedestrians are left with no real space.

does anyone know if there’s any plan to repair this road? i hardly see posts about this stretch here — am i the only one facing this?

just needed to rant and check if anyone has updates.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"civic sense starts with civic infrastructure. people are now talking a lot about civic sense, and while it’s a good thing, has anyone actually wondered why people behave the way they do? everyone is quick to shout about manners and responsibility, but no one looks at the conditions people live in.

most of the issues blamed on lack of civic sense, like littering, trash dumping, or urinating in the open, happen because basic facilities simply don’t exist. if there were dustbins every hundred metres, why would anyone throw trash on the street? if garbage was collected regularly, why would people dump it in open spaces? if there were clean public toilets available, why would anyone urinate in the open?

and because people have grown up seeing this around them, they’ve become psychologically conditioned to think it’s normal. when an environment repeatedly reinforces certain behaviour, the brain registers it as acceptable. people aren’t inherently careless; they have just adapted to what the system has shown them all their lives.

we blame the citizens for lack of civic sense but rarely hold municipalities accountable for not providing the infrastructure that actually makes civic behaviour possible. until that changes, shouting “have some civic sense” will remain just another buzzword people repeat for social approval.

in the end, it’s just a perspective, but one worth thinking about.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"the lingering shadow of bhopal gas tragedy 3 december 2025 marks the forty-first anniversary of the massive toxic gas leak from union carbide corporation's chemical plant in bhopal in the state of madhya pradesh, india, that killed more than 3,800 people. over time, it’s estimated that more than 22,000 people died from mic exposure and more than half a million were maimed for life. survivors have faced chronic health issues, three generations of birth defects, economic consequences, and ongoing groundwater contamination from unsafe disposal of poisonous wastes at the pesticide plant.

in 1969, the union carbide india limited (ucil) started its operation at the bhopal plant to produce the pesticide sevin.  the plant was initially approved only for the formulation of pesticides, using imported intermediates, including methyl isocyanate (mic). however, the plant began manufacturing the intermediate chemical methyl isocyanate (mic) on-site in 1979 as part of a ""backward integration"" strategy to lower costs and reduce import dependency. 

local managers were directed to close the plant and prepare it for sale in july 1984. when no ready buyer was found, ucil made plans to dismantle key production units of the facility for shipment to another developing country. in the meantime, the facility continued to operate with safety equipment and procedures far below the standards found in its sister plant in institute, west virginia. the local government was aware of safety problems, but was reticent to place heavy industrial safety and pollution control.

at 11:00 pm on december 2, 1984, an operator at a bhopal plant noticed a small leak of methyl isocyanate (mic) gas and rising pressure in a storage tank. a safety scrubber had been turned off weeks earlier, and a faulty valve allowed one ton of water to mix with forty tons of mic. additionally, a refrigeration unit meant to cool the tank was drained of coolant, and the gas flare safety system had been out of order for three months. at around 1:00 am on december 3, a safety valve failed, releasing a plume of mic gas into the air. within hours, bhopal's streets were filled with human and animal corpses.

hamidia hospital, bhopal’s largest and closest to the disaster site, was flooded with people experiencing blindness and injuries to their airways and lungs. many of the deaths were a result of pulmonary edema, a condition in which fluid accumulates in the lungs and can cause respiratory failure. this fluid buildup resulted from an inflammatory response that was triggered by exposure to high levels of mic.

estimates suggest that up to 10,000 people may have died in the initial days due to the ucc plant plume, with 15,000 to 20,000 additional premature deaths over the next two decades. the indian government reported that over half a million people were exposed to the gas, and several studies indicated increased morbidity and mortality in the affected population.

researchers from the university of california (uc) conducted a comprehensive analysis to assess the long-term health consequences and potential intergenerational effects of the bhopal gas tragedy. they gathered data from the national family health survey (nfhs-4) conducted between 2015 and 2016 and the integrated public use microdata series from india for the year 1999, including individuals ranging from ages six to 64 years and those in utero at the time of the disaster.

* women who were pregnant with male fetuses and resided within 100 km of bhopal had a one percentage point higher disability rate that affected their employment 15 years later.
* there was a decline in the proportion of male births from 64% (1981-1984) to 60% (1985) among mothers living within 100 km of bhopal suggesting a higher vulnerability of male fetuses to external stress.
* men born in 1985 within 100 km of bhopal had an eightfold higher risk of cancer compared to those born in the periods 1976-1984 and 1986-1990.
* furthermore, men born in 1985 who continued to reside within 100 km of bhopal experienced a 27-fold higher risk of cancer in 2015 compared to their counterparts born in the reference periods and individuals living more than 100 km away.
* those who were in utero during the tragedy and lived within 100 km of bhopal were one percentage point more likely to report employment disability compared to older individuals and those residing further from bhopal.

the site was never properly cleaned, resulting in toxic waste seeping into the groundwater and contaminating wells for decades. chloroform concentrations were found to be as much as 3.5 times higher than the established drinking water guidelines. carbon tetrachloride levels also reached up to 2,400 times above these guidelines.

the world moved on. the corporation escaped. but in bhopal, the poison is in the soil, in the water, and in the bodies of a third generation.

reddit,"beware of donation scams in bangalore! recently, my brother, who recently moved to bangalore for work, encountered a disturbing scam that i believe everyone in the city should be aware of. one evening, as he was leaving his office, he was approached by individuals claiming to collect donations for various causes, such as improving bangalore's infrastructure or reducing pollution through initiatives like introducing more electric buses.

being new to the city and encouraged by a colleague, my brother engaged with these individuals. they managed to convince him and his friend to make a donation, resulting in a payment of 800 rupees each. what's shocking is that the payment was made through their net banking, and it turned out to be an e-mandate lasting for the next 30 years!

this experience exposed a disturbing scam targeting unsuspecting individuals who want to contribute positively to bangalore's development. when i contacted customer care to rectify this, they directed me to visit the hdfc bank branch, where officials informed me that canceling the e-mandate would take about 7 days. what's more frustrating is that the e-mandate isn't even visible in the sihub of hdfc bank, where one typically sees listed e-mandates for services like hotstar or netflix.

this incident serves as a reminder to always be vigilant and cautious when approached for donations or charitable contributions, especially when dealing with online transactions and e-mandates. let's spread awareness to prevent others from falling victim to such scams in our community.

stay safe, bangalore!",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"why govt is not incentivised to solve pollution problem ? considering how delhi / punjab / up / haryana or the centre has let this issue persist for more a decade. was thinking about the reasons for insufficient action of govt. and its pretty clear why this issue is here to stay.

the advantage of air pollution to govts:

1) delhi govt has doubled parking charges for all major places like c.p / khan market - so double the earning for no extra work.

2) a lot of challans are being issued due to non valid puc (which i don't know how useful it is) or using bs-iii engine - again a big excuse to extract lots of money for no real work.

3) petrol cars now have 15 years &amp; diesel cars have 10 year life, after that they are not allowed in delhi. so just like that, it has accelerated the buy-sell cycle of car. in all of this, the govt enjoys heavy gst + cess &amp; road tax and what not.

4) folks have to buy air purifiers, give 18% gst

5) get health issues - buy medicines, get hospitalisation - more tax to govt.

6) scared so you buy health insurance ? - 18% tax to govt.

7) easy blame game - state govt blames center, center blames state govt. so if the blame is not on you, why you take action ?

8) people forget issue in feb. so why bother as come april - may, they will complain about rising heat &amp; then about water logging in monsoon.

------------------------------------------

consider the opposite, if govt takes some strict action:

1) farmers will be angry, you lose election

2) tell companies to fix their waste - industrialists get angry and you get less donation

3) all the free tax collection due to newer cars, challans, air purifiers, medical bills etc will be lost

4) extra money would have to be spend in cleaning all the dust on street

5) since its easy to divert blame, its also difficult to get full credit - for any good work, both state &amp; center govts will claim credit, so it won't lead to major votes gain.

------------------------------------------

the rich and politically connected have their purifiers and can go abroad if needed.

the poor will anyway have a difficult life, and can be easily won over by schemes like ladli bahen.

the middle class is stuck - they have jobs, their kids go to school in the city, they have small shops in the city. its not easy to sell everything, disrupt your entire family and just go somewhere else.

------------------------------------------

based on all of this, i feel thats it's obvious that govts have no reason at all to fix the situation. its here to stay &amp; we are doomed.

edit - not just govt, we are part of the problem too. we can vent just on reddit &amp; twitter. but won't take to the street - we are too afraid that we can lose our job, face govt backlash, thrown into prison, so taking the coward way out by being a keyboard warrior.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"frequent power cuts in bangalore are disrupting our lives—what’s going on bescom? i’m beyond frustrated with the constant power cuts in bangalore. in a city that’s home to the highest number of it firms, it’s absurd that we’re dealing with 2-3 hour power outages every other day. with the hybrid working model becoming the norm, it’s nearly impossible to work from home under these conditions.

bescom’s reliability is seriously questionable. how can something be “under maintenance” every single day? are they really fixing anything, or are we just caught in an endless cycle of band-aid solutions? the lack of transparency and frequent outages are not just inconvenient—they’re damaging to our productivity and well-being.

has anyone else been experiencing this? what can we do to hold bescom accountable and push for a more reliable power supply? this can’t continue if bangalore wants to maintain its status as a leading tech hub.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"bangalore’s road safety crisis: the data, the solutions, and how we can push for change hey everyone,

i've been driving in our city for over 11 years without a single traffic violation, but i've had my share of close calls (like yesterday when a parked car suddenly pulled out while i was passing it, causing a minor rear-end collision with a two-wheeler behind me).

these experiences made me curious about what works to make roads safer, so i dove into the data. what i found was shocking - it's not just apathetic drivers causing traffic problems.

the data

- 74% of bangalore traffic deaths are pedestrians and two-wheeler riders
- 14 crashes happen every day in bangalore urban alone
- karnataka loses 12,321 lives annually to traffic crashes (2023)
- this costs our economy 3-5% of gdp nationwide
- tamil nadu cut fatalities by 18% and gujarat by 8% with coordinated safety programs - proving solutions work in indian context
- fatal crashes dropped 18% near purple line metro stations but increased 11% on feeder roads lacking proper crossings
- the framework for a points based licensing system was already added into the law through the 2020 amendment but hasn’t been implemented yet.

what actually works

1. 30 km/h school/residential zones + raised crossings (saves ~410 lives per ₹100 cr invested)
   - singapore did this and virtually eliminated school-area deaths 

2. gps speed governors for buses &amp; commercial vehicles (saves ~340 lives per ₹100 cr)
   - kenya tried this and cut fatal crashes by 30%

3. intersection improvements with atcs + ai cameras (saves ~270 lives per ₹100 cr)
   - bengaluru's pilot already cut violations by 23%

what's stopping us?

it's not knowledge - it's funding and political will. karnataka only allocates 0.14% of its transport budget to road safety while crashes drain 3-5% of gdp. and, the central government only allocated ₹273 crore (0.10% of morth's budget) towards road safety.

what can we do?

i want to draft open letters to nitin gadkari and the karnataka cm with specific policy asks. would anyone:
1. be willing to share your own near-miss stories?
2. have connections to rwas or school ptas who might support a 30km/h zone petition?
3. join a twitter/instagram campaign to highlight dangerous intersections?
4. insert your name in letter?

tl;dr: 
bangalore's roads are unnecessarily dangerous. simple, cost-effective solutions exist but aren't being implemented. let's push our government to act.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"bbmp under dks has 675 cr funds unreleased, sitting around doing nothing for almost 3 months now. curious if there are any civic minded folks on here who are following this? unfinished metro pillars falling and killing people, tons of potholes and roads dug up, a depleted civic body that is in the hands of the politicians. why are citizens of bengaluru so complacent? i also don't understand how people simply blame the bbmp officials when politicians are clearly treating our civic bodies like it's their personal bank account. i'm worried that very soon only the relatives of politicians will be running things and actually qualified firms will exit the businesses involved with city infrastructure and running since it's so torturous to get your own money back.
the implications of the state governments actions are quite far reaching(labour is at a standstill, suppliers haven't been paid, only private financiers are gaining since thousands and thousands of people across the state are waiting for the 'new' government to release funds.

how is it normal for municipal services to be controlled by the state government? i'm really curious to hear the opinions and thoughts of regular folks and what you think of state and municipal budgets etc.? why do the politicians regardless of affiliation seem so hungry for more and more money? seems like they are only business friendly when it's their own. do people actually not care or are they just not aware about how far reaching the problems are?

reddit,"uttarahalli- kengeri road: a daily hell ride that desperately needs attention hello fellow bengalureans,

i’ve been commuting via the uttarahalli kengeri road for the past six months, mostly on weekends, and what was once a tolerable patch of road has now deteriorated into a nightmare. it has genuinely gone from bad to worse, and that’s putting it mildly.

this stretch has become a near-constant obstacle course. there’s gravel scattered across the road, deep diamond-shaped cuts, missing patches of road, and more potholes than i can count. in many places, the road feels like a continuous rumble strip for several kms. and when you throw in peak-hour traffic, it becomes a hazardous and bone-rattling hell ride every single day.

i had hoped some patchwork would be done before the monsoons, but instead, the situation has only gotten worse. during the heavy rains in may, parts of the road had knee-deep water, two-wheelers were stalling, and i witnessed several vehicles with dead engines struggling to restart. for a road used by thousands daily, this is beyond unacceptable.

this road  connects major points such as rnsit, bgs, jss, and sattva global city. it’s also lined with several gated communities from top builders including sobha, brigade, prestige, and mantri. given the sheer number of institutions, tech employees, and local residents relying on this road, it’s shocking how neglected it has become.

i remember reading about a terrible accident last year on this very road, after which residents of a nearby gated community blocked the road in protest. clearly, that momentum has faded, but the issues persist and have multiplied.

i want to ask those of you living along this stretch:

1. how are you commuting on this road everyday?

2. has anyone raised this issue with the local mlas?

(i believe this road falls between bengaluru south and
 rr nagar assembly constituencies and do the folks representing them have responded positively to this?)

3. has anyone approached the ruling party or bbmp officials or anyone else on this matter?

given that this is a densely populated area with a strong voter base, we must ask — why is there zero will to fix it? i truly hope that residents from these areas come together to pressurise the authorities to fix this road.

let’s not wait for another accident or monsoon disaster. if you reside here, please raise your voice. use your vote wisely and press the authorities to take immediate action. 

this isn’t just about convenience. it’s about safety, dignity, and the livability of our city, which i’m sure is dear to all of us.

thanks for reading. let’s hope this post sparks some accountability and hope that damn road is fixed asap.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"extremely disappointed with livpure ro – frequent failures &amp; poor service i am extremely frustrated with **livpure ro’s** service and after-sales support. i purchased their **ro subscription**, expecting a hassle-free experience, but in just a few months, my ro has stopped working **four times**—**december, january, february, and now again in march**.

# issues i’m facing:

1. **frequent breakdowns:** every alternate month, the ro stops working, making us completely dependent on backup water sources.
2. **inefficient customer support:** every time i complain, the customer care team just raises a service request and sends an engineer, but the issue keeps coming back.
3. **unprofessional engineers:** the assigned engineer does not diagnose the problem properly, is irresponsible, and even misbehaves.
4. **no compensation for downtime:** during these breakdowns, livpure has **hiked recharge prices** but refuses to compensate customers by either **extending the subscription or providing partial refunds**.
5. **unacceptable delay in service:** i just contacted customer support again, and they are now asking me to wait **5 days** for an engineer or **10 days** for a replacement.

has anyone else faced similar issues with livpure? how did you resolve it? would love to hear your experiences!",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"adoption alert bangalore recently a community cat chhotu (mom) who was ferocious and territorial but loving to the feeder  died in generator room due to electric shock. the 4 beautiful kittens have been rescued from the janitor room after 4 days struggle.

vet checkup is already done. 

dewormed, de-flead, litter trained, healthy and extremely playful.

they seem to be better adjusted to human interaction now after recovering from their mother's death

the three tabbies are female (bella, ruby and stripey) and the fourth one (alpha) is probably mixed siamese and male.

preference is to get them adopted in pairs : bella &amp; stripey, ruby &amp; alpha. alpha would be given as a pair only as he is a scaredy kitten and would need his bonded sibling ruby with him to feel better. 


please come forward to adopt them.

dm me for more details.

now they are doing pr saying its to ease congestion, its, total brainwashing. if they are not giving exit or alternate commute to those who are stuck in traffic then how come they got permission? its shocking if someone has money can do anything in bengaluru but we keep on suffering all the time! road is open to public but that's not enough.

my idea is, government should take it as opportunity to fix traffic problem by giving atleast one alternative route instead of one exit in 1.5 km flyover! also they should stop giving permission for more it parks in orr. they need to co-plan.",PseudoTopic_0

a trip which usually takes maybe 45 minutes even in peak traffic took me two hours. even the shortcuts were jam packed and the roads had massive potholes in them. 

stay safe, guys. plan your routes well.

reddit,"how to get power back in 10 mins in banglore after powercut i made this post about a month ago about how i improved the electricity supply in my area and powercut dropped from 1hr daily to 5 mins a week - https://www.reddit.com/r/india/s/9mf1evn3md

i wanted to test if it works as well as in karnataka as it works in wb and to my surprise it actually does. if you have a powercut or powercut problem in your area then just dial 1912. tell the bescom provider that you have a power cut, you can either tell them about the area where powercut has happened or just give your consumer id. they will create a docket and the electrician will come and fix the issue asap. for those who prefer apps instead, download the bescom mithra app, can't tell about the effectiveness of the app yet but calling them definitely works. it does not end there, i saw many powerlines and poles in very bad state and over drains which might be hazardous and prone to accidents. you can also complain against it and they will come and fix it instead of waiting for something bad to happen for them to take notice of the issue.

power cuts may be rare and might not last long but if you raise a complaint it will definitely get solved instead of waiting for them to fix it on its own.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"suggestion: solve bengaluru water crisis by privatizing water supply and bswbb solve bengaluru water crisis by privatizing water supply and bswbb!


unpopular idea - government doesn't know how to fix water problems in city of bengaluru.

1. bengaluru is the tech hub of india and the city will grow evermore in the future. cities public infrastructure has not been able to keep up.

if public infrastructure is bad in bangalore the city will loose it's attractiveness as the indian it hub.

many indian cities like hyderabad, coimbatore, chennai have been competing to get these investments. bangalore must not loose this competitiveness.

2. government is extremely inefficient in managing any resource. bswbb has basically failed in it's duties.

just remember the days when all we had was ambassador cars, bsnl telecom and air india. how bad was services provided by them. these companies were extension of the government with monopoly status.

3. privatization made india what it is. we were a struggling country - after 1990s we had a massive economic boom thanks to privatization.

3. the indian growth story we know exists because of lpg reforms by pm mr. narasimha rao.

liberalisation, privatization and globalisation improved our country.

4. when government was monopoly every sector was performing badly - private competition made the country a lot better in every aspect.

5. across india power utilities have been privatized - e.g reliance and tata power is supplying electricity efficiently to whole of delhi. torrent power has been managing electricity supply to city of ahmedabad, gujarat.

poor will never suffer - delhi power is managed by private companies. but government regulates it and subsidises power for poor. infact for the poor, the most affordable power is available in delhi (it's free for some units!) despite being managed by private company.

5. sanitation is outsourced - entire chennai city waste is efficiently managed by a spanish company urbaser sumeet.

6. even metro rail has been successfully outsourced - hyderabad metro is operated by kelios a french company.

7. many cities like bangalore where the government struggled with providing water &amp; sanitation outsourced the same to private sector, which made the services so much.

8. nagpur, maharashtra had really terrible water supply system.

veolia a french company took over the nagpur cities water supply - waste has been reduced, water was made safe, water supply and infrastructure drastically improved.

private sector invests in the correct infrastructure, reduces wastes and leakages and manages the supply properly.

9. there are many such examples where privatization and outsourcing of water supply actually improved services.

10. government could explore privatizing water supply and making bswbb a regulator than a supplier or even dismantling the incapable water utility company.

bswbb has proven incompetence. there is no point in paying huge salaries to government bureaucrats just to see the tanker owners making all the money while bangalore eternally suffers.

if not full fledged privatization, a staged privatization with ppp model could work.",PseudoTopic_0

many other smaller municipal corps have [adopted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhagjfxspeu) it. bbpm 2025-26 budget is \~ rs 20,000 cr. cant they afford a contract with such machines. 

a)  it'll stop manual scavenging. there is already a [2013 national act ](https://ncsk.nic.in/sites/default/files/manualsca-act19913635738516382444610.pdf)to stop manual scavenging.   
b) it'd be much cleaner &amp; healthier for pedestrians/ local folks  
c) it'll be more efficient in time and quality of work

i guess for last 6-8 weeks its been happening in some or the other corner of sarjapura road from manipal hospital to carmelaram. 

\- i don't understand, how the current operations are not in violation of the 2013 act.

reddit,"is the tunnel road worth destroying our city's heritage - the lalbagh botanical garden? if you have been reading the news, there is some alarming information coming out about the tunnel road project. the route carves directly beneath bengaluru's lush lalbagh garden, and the damage could be permanent. in fact, news says a 1.1km two-lane ramp of the tunnel road will pass right beneath the **3-billion-year-old rock formation** inside lalbagh botanical garden. this rock is a geological marvel. can we really risk losing that? 

with each passing day it just feels like we have our priorities all wrong. what truly makes our city unique are its green lungs and its historical landmarks, not high-speed, car-centric infrastructure. this multi-crore investment only benefits a small percentage of private vehicle owners. why cannot we find better ways to have sustainable development projects? 

what are your thoughts?

reddit,"rethinking india's stance on dual citizenship: a loss of identity and opportunity dear r/india,

i recently came across this article on the [goans for goa](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/goans-portuguese-nationality-problem-renewing-their-indian-passport-9067528/) movement, and that has made me ponder over india's stance on dual or multiple citizenships and the implications it has on our global diaspora. the recent legal changes (vide a circular issued in 2022 by the ministry of home affairs) and instances of citizenship revocation have brought to light a broader issue: the rigid policies that force a choice between *karmabhoomi* (land of action) and *janmabhoomi* (land of birth).

## the heart of the matter:

india's policy of not allowing dual citizenship is not just a legal issue; it's a matter of identity and belonging. for many of us with deep-rooted connections to india, being forced to choose between our homeland and our place of residence feels unfair. it's a choice no one should have to make.

## the case of oci revocation:

take, for example, the cases where overseas citizenship of india (oci) cards have been revoked for criticizing the government (see [ashok swain case](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/delhi-hc-seeks-centres-stand-on-ashok-swains-plea-against-cancellation-of-oci-card/article67295137.ece)). this isn't just about a travel document; it's about silencing voices and cutting ties with the motherland. it's a form of bullying that undermines the very principles of democracy and free speech.

## democracy and individual rights:

india prides itself on being the world's largest democracy. a democracy should protect individual rights, including the right to maintain a relationship with one's motherland. the current policy seems to overlook this fundamental aspect, treating those who live abroad as less entitled to their indian identity.

## the loss for india:

this rigid policy is not just a loss for individuals; it's a loss for india too. the global indian community contributes significantly to the world in various fields. by forcing a choice, we risk alienating a valuable part of our culture and heritage.

## the need for a national conversation:

it's time we reevaluate our stance on dual citizenship. this is not about pointing fingers at any particular government or administration; it's about recognizing that this policy, in its current form, is outdated. we need a national conversation around this, one that respects the complexities of identity and the realities of a globalized world.

## conclusion:

why should it be a choice between *karmabhoomi* and *janmabhoomi*? what right do the powers in new delhi have to dictate the nature of our relationship with our motherland? i urge you all to think about this and share your thoughts. it's time for a change, and it starts with us.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"i got 40 km expressway cleaned using cpgrams portal! tl;dr - i asked the highway department in wb to clean the expressway to prevent accident and buy cleaning machines to keep the highway clean and they actually did it!

hey guys want to share another great news this weekend with you guys. if you remember, [i shared last week how i got wbsedcl to improve their service with my email](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1i4yc3p/i_potentially_improved_the_lives_of_203_crore/). i travelled last month via a newly built expressway in wb. i rarely use this road but its very well made expressway. a huge shoutout to wbhdcl(west bengal highway authority) for making such an amazing expressway.

while travelling i found a issue on the entire stretch of the highway. the highway was not maintained very well. the highway was collecting dust and white sand and was accumulating on the side of the highway and when cars used to go at high speed, it was being spread on the road back again which was causing skidding in vehicles. this was a serious issue and though i don't use it much i thought i should inform about this to wbhdcl to help reduce accidents. i wrote a small complain with some suggestions to clean the road daily and buy cleaning machine to properly handle dust and sand accumulation on the road via cpgrams portal. 

i visited the expressway this week and saw people cleaning and collecting dust with broom and hand shovel at a crossing. i was happy to see it but i thought it would have been better if they used cleaning machines but atleast they are cleaning it now. 10km ahead i saw it, a road cleaning machine attached to a tractor, it wasn't the modern cleaning machines seen in the city but it was not spreading the dust and sand and actually picking it properly(pic attached, not original pic but similar, as i wasn't able to stop and take pic on expressway) i was so happy to see the road lanes cleared of sand. i complained to them a month ago and they actually took it positively and took action. the expressway has been open for quite a few months but this is the first time i saw cleaning machines deployed. it is highly possible that they already had plans on cleaning the roads but i never saw it cleaned before i complained so i believe my suggestions nudged them to take action to clean the road and prevent accidents. there is still a lot of sands at merging intersection and some other parts of the expressway but the main highway and its sidelines are mostly clean now, hoping they keep it up and clean everything soon.

moral of the story - if you find a problem please take action, please complain to the correct authority, please do something. if nothing just shoot an email to the govt, 80% chance they won't check it but the other 20% is a big deal, what if they actually read it and get it fixed like the above case. my complaint possibly saved hundreds from accident as roads are clean and free of sand. if you are stuck in traffic, have roads filled with potholes, garbage on the road etc. don't sit back and accept it, tell the govt you want it fixed, they will fix things when people actually demand it. 

my reason for sharing all these things are to show the people how easy it can be to bring change, you might not even have to step out of your home to bring change and improve lives of lakhs of people in india, all i ask you is to be selfish and complain for the things that only matter to you, complain for only the roads you travel by, cleanliness in the area you travel by daily. i see people thinking i am some activist trying to bring change but that is far from the truth. i am a simple man working 9-5 with no connections or influence. all that is different between me and the rest is that when i face a problem like bad roads, potholes, garbage problem etc, i take 5 mins out of my time and tell the govt there is a problem and ask them to fix it. i don't go around fixing all the problems in wb or banglore or any other state when i visit it, all i try to fix are the things that bother me, if everyone does the same, every neighbourhood would improve drastically in india.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"i got scammed by nobroker for 19k: lessons learnt that i want to share hi to all nodes of the network,  
i write this so that my experience, although painful to me, may bring awareness and benefit to others.

in short, the lessons i draw are thus,  
\* do not trust anything that nobroker executives say over call

\* tell them to send the details of the flat/property over mail

\* take every promise over mail or in any other written format. everything else is a marketing gimmick

the complete story:

* i took the nobroker relax tenant for plan (\~4k) in january 2025 (ironic, since this plan only gave me stress)
* was shown a property in cv raman nagar but it was on a rooftop and there was something off about it
* after the property visit, the nobroker rm (relationship manager) asked me if wanted the property for rent, i refused saying i had concerns if the construction was legal (i was clear about my requirements i wanted a legal construction with a legal address, with previous electricity bills for government purposes)
* as soon as i had expressed my concerns about the flat's legality, i got a slew of calls from various nobroker executives (i will not take their names here because i don't want to blame an individual and i believe the work culture and pressure at nobroker must be fault) trying to convince me that the flat is legal, it a has an address and assured me that the owner would share previous months' electricity bills too
* i told them i don't want to proceed without even knowing the actual flat number of the property (i vaguely remember when i visited the flat that i did not spot a flat number on the door)
* one rm from nobroker lied to me over call and gave me some fake flat number. he assured me that ""nobroker is a big brand"", that he has been in the company for long and that they verify every property and that ""every call is recorded""
* i was convinced by his smooth talk. i thought worst case the call has been recorded, and i can just point to the call if things go south (boy, was i wrong)
* so, to proceed i had to pay an advance of 15k (7k to nb, 8k to the owner). i did so. (i should have bought a ticket to nepal, in hindsight, and run to the mountains)
* when the owner then shared the rent agreement with me, he had mentioned a flat number which was completely different from what the nobroker rm had told me. i realized something was deeply wrong
* i visited the society and asked the security guard himself if such a flat exists. he smiled. i realized all the flat numbers in the society had three digits. the flat number given to me was 4 digits. it was an illegal construction on the terrace of the apartment which was being pushed off as a flat. i felt like a complete idiot
* i asked the owner about this, as soon as he saw my whatsapp message he deleted the rent agreement (image attached). i still have a copy of the draft rent agreement though
* i tried calling the various rms about the lies. at first, they said they shall look into the issue. then they stopped picking up my phone calls
* i talked to the nobroker customer support multiple times. i even told them to check their recorded calls.
* nobroker told me: no calls between nobroker and me happened on that day and thus they have no records. this was so ridiculous it was funny! if no calls had happened, then how did the deal get closed?
* i realized it was an exercise in futility to approach nobroker.
* i am considering my options now which include ejagriti or the consumer court but honestly because of personal commitments i do not know how to settle this issue without long court battles. i tried the national consumer helpline but they advised to me to go the consumer court.

however, what this experience has taught me is not trust the word of an exec but take every communication in mail.  
thanks for your attention and may your day go well.  
\[alas, i realize i cannot attach images in this thread\]

big thanks to you guys and the power of reddit, i was recently contacted by nobroker and they agreed to refund a partial amount, 7k, (the nobroker executive was able to identify the case with this reddit post and i was literally told on call this is regarding your complaint post on reddit). all those calls and follow-ups were futile but one post on reddit galvanized them into action. apparently, it still is going to be a struggle to fetch the complete amount (12k remains) back and i have to see what my further options would be but reddit made a powerful impact.   
  
**make no mistake i am still deeply disappointed by nobroker** and would **not** recommend it to anyone, but i wanted to express my thanks to this community. community expression and support can really be a powerful thing. to all those who texted me via chat, thank you for your support and sorry for not replying but i cannot seem to access the chat \[""unable to join the room""\]. 

new lessons learnt,

\* any community needs platforms for expression of voices to be heard

\* consumers supporting other consumers is a force multiplier

\* if follow-ups, mails, calls fail, approach such a platform to raise awareness and you might be rewarded with something too :)",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"why is human life so cheap in india? whenever i read a newspaper or watch the news on television, i’m struck by the growing number of crimes, accidents, and violent incidents happening across india. it often feels as though we’ve lost our sense of empathy and regard for human life. many teenagers drive recklessly, endangering themselves and others. infrastructure failures like collapsing bridges and unsafe public transport only add to the chaos. people seem increasingly short-tempered, reacting with anger even over minor issues, and the air quality continues to deteriorate.

i’ve especially noticed that after covid, many individuals appear more irritable and on edge. meanwhile, the government tends to silence criticism rather than enforce strong actions against wrongdoers. in many cases, those responsible for serious offences seem to have political connections, which allows them to escape accountability.

potholes claim lives, train accidents occur far too often, yet meaningful action is rare. it’s disheartening to see these problems persist without substantial solutions.

victims of terror attacks haven't got any justice. those terrorist who killed 26 people in pahalgam still roaming freely.

those who were responsible for the crash of ai-171 still haven't been charged or hold responsible.


on other hand scandinavian countries and japan value human life alot. they take severe action against those responsible. but in india it's *chalta hai* mindset.

no wonder why hni are leaving india. when the law and order is so broken, who want's to live in such place.

living in this country is like final destination movie. you don't know what's gonna happen and those responsible will be punished.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"is hyderabad actually better than bangalore in terms of quality of life? hey folks,

i wanted to get some real, honest opinions from people living in **bangalore (especially marathahalli/whitefield)** and **hyderabad**.

i’m an it professional currently based in bangalore. while the city offers great opportunities, a solid tech ecosystem, and vibrant social life, the **infrastructure (especially roads and traffic)** is honestly wearing me down. i live around **marathahalli/whitefield**, and commuting has become a major source of stress — potholes, traffic jams, unpredictable travel times, etc.

i'm considering **hyderabad** as an alternative. i’ve heard it has:

* better roads and city planning
* less traffic congestion
* cheaper cost of living
* rapidly growing tech sector (google, amazon, microsoft, etc.)

at the same time, bangalore is still the biggest it hub in india, with arguably more job options and a stronger startup ecosystem. another huge plus is bangalore's weather (i'd rather stand in traffic in a pleasant weather).

so i’m torn. i'd love to hear from:

* people who **moved from bangalore to hyderabad** — was it worth it?
* anyone living in **hyderabad** — how’s the work culture, commute, and overall life quality?
* folks in **marathahalli/whitefield** — are you thinking of moving too, or do you think bangalore is still the best bet?

also curious about:

* schooling, healthcare, and housing comparisons
* long-term growth potential
* any cultural or language barriers

would really appreciate your insights to help make an informed decision!

thanks in advance 😊",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"why are we risking sankey tank for a car project? i am sure that sankey tank is one of the favorite places in bangalore for thousands of us! but it is now under threat due to the tunnel road project. recent news reports state that there will be an exit ramp right next to the tank! can you imagine? the traffic, flood risk, noise, and air pollution.

do we even need the tunnel road if the route almost entirely overlaps with the long-overdue red line of namma metro! sankey tank is part of bangalore's heritage. how can we casually risk its destruction for a new road! the apparent disregard for our heritage and well-being is so apparent in the actions of the karnataka government.

first it was lalbagh, and now it is sankey tank—how much more of our collective heritage will the karnataka government sacrifice next for a car-centric project that will ultimately only create more traffic and pollution!!

what are your thoughts?

reddit,"argued over throwing garbage on the road **tl;dr:** saw someone throw garbage, confronted him, argued for 15 minutes, and now i’m overthinking whether it was even worth it, was i being a prick or that was the right thing to do.

so this happened on the evening of **9th oct**. i was walking back home after picking up laundry from my local laundromat when i saw this guy step out of a shop and casually throw a cardboard box on the road.

i was honestly baffled. walked a few steps, reached his shop, and said:  
“yaake guru, yaake illi kasa esuttidira?”  
(“why man, why are you throwing garbage here?”)

he turned around and said, “kya hua?”  
so i replied, “aap kachra kyun phenkte ho road pe?”

he came out, and we started arguing.

**me:** yeh sab mat karo, chhota dustbin rakh lo. main yahan rehta hoon, gandagi mat failao.  
**him:** main bhi yahin rehta hoon.  
**me:** kaunsa cross? (i knew he was lying.)  
**him:** yahin pe.  
**me:** kahan? my neighborhood? domlur? indiranagar? ulsoor? kidhar rehte ho?  
**him:** ruk, location deta hoon.  
**me:** yaar, aapke ghar pe koi kachra daale toh acha lagega kya? mat dala karo road pe.

he shrugged and said, *“ab phenk diya toh phenk diya.”* then came the excuses:

* everyone throws garbage, why single me out?
* the food stall ahead also throws.
* daily wagers eat gutka and litter.
* trees shed leaves too — that’s also garbage.

i told him, *“i can only correct what’s in front of me. i’m not going to run to modi ji or dk shivakumar for this. you own a medical store, you seem educated — this is your area, your road.”*

things got a bit heated. he said, *“what will you do, hit me?”*  
i said, *“why would i hit you?”*

then another older man — a kannadiga uncle — stepped in, probably his acquaintance, and said, *“karnataka dalli kannada matadi.”*  
i told him, *“heli sir, nanage kannada barutte.”*  
didn’t want to escalate it, so i said, *“okay sir, neevu hogi.”*.  
i said ""please dhyaan rakho"" and left.

in the end, i just felt like i’d wasted 15 minutes.

here’s the thing — i’m a bit obsessive about cleanliness. even with friends or cousins, i tell them not to litter. sometimes i even pick up cigarette butts myself. they used to laugh, but now they’ve stopped littering too out of shame. we just try to leave every place as we found it — because it isn't possible to clean up after others.

i’m not even originally from bangalore, but after living here so long, it feels like home. it genuinely hurts to see people just mess things up and shrug it off. sure, the government is negligent, but that doesn’t mean we stop behaving responsibly as individuals.

anyway, that’s my little rant. couldn’t sleep, so i thought i’d share.

ps: my kannada is so-so. please don't judge.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"tirupati temple (dire situation) part 1
my parents just visited the temple yesterday as we live in blr they booked a bus for 3k and it showed as special darshan. the bus left at 8:30 from blr and reached the temple by 2:30.
they were asked to leave for the temple by 3 in the night so that they can get in the line by 5 am
 
part 2
they entered the gates and were asked to submit the phones and other belongings.no water bottles were allowed(later this becomes a big mistake)and after that they entered a waiting hall of 2k ppl.
part 3
now this is where the problem starts they had to wait in that hall for about 6 hours and even after that they were asked to wait longer after taking 1 full round and cam back to the same place.

the hall and other places have all the facilities but their maintenance is a menace for a temple of this stature the hygiene levels are nasty. we are always taught to be at are cleanest near temples and other holy places but the situation there was horrible.

there were sources of ro water but people were using that same water for all purposes due to which it was impossible for my parents to drink from a place where people are using that water for all activities.

there was food and other refreshments served but that caused an even bigger issue as that led people to take them in such large ammounts and whatever was being left over was being thrown on the same ground you are standing in 

part 4
my father after seeing the situation tried call the emergency number from the phone available but there was no response. vendors were selling tetrapacks and other refreshments but they were also being consumed at such a rate bcz u cant imagine staying in a hall with no entry or exit with 2k ppl arround you and in such bad cleanliness.
(as my mom stated it felt like a jail).

part 5
in the end they had to book a hotel and go back and did the darshan on the next day morning.

i was really taken aback and sad that this is the status of one of the worlds richest temple and i had visited the same a long time ago my dad did state that the amenities have increases but there is no maintenance.

as such a holy place in our culture with such significance i would really like the situation to change.

if anyone else has visited in recent time please do share your experience.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"flipkart has scammed me and now i don't know what to do i ordered a zephyrus g16 from flipkart and i was anxious as fuck knowing what i am signup up for. didn't think i would get so unlucky. the delivery was done after a delay and i checked the product and it seemed ok. afterwards i tried to register my warranty on the laptop and it said that this device is already registered which raised a concern in my head immediately... so i checked the warranty information by serial number and it said that the laptop is going to expire next month of this year.. which is impossible.. then i find out this laptop is used and refurbished, the laptop was put into rma process by another customer who purchased it and it was approved for rma and then probably sold as a brand refurbished... however i was sold this unit as a retailing brand new unit at retail price of ₹2,36,990.

i contacted flipkart about this, they tell me they're scheduling a technician visit which made no sense, so i contacted asus with the details of the issue and the visit they tell me they cannot give me a doa because it's not doa and they can't provide jobsheet of service since the laptop is functional. the issue is irrelevant to asus and that the problem stems from the seller giving me a used product. now i am stuck. flipkart won't help me and keep asking the same thing and asus cannot provide me document for something that's untrue.

i escalated to nch, and flipkart simply said the same thing and closed the case on nch. i reached out to nch and they told me to just go to edakhil and take legal action. i can't believe that this has been allowed to go as far as me having to file a court case. is this really it? can't do anything else? i am so done with this..


update : the seller was smartlaptop7 / the overclockers in mumbai lamington road. gst is registered under the name of sandeep bhansali. 

update 2 : here is a list of things that i've accumulated from researching about the laptop before coming to any conclusion. 

1. unboxing video - learned that brand new units cannot turn on without power supply first given, the unit turned on with battery only. 

2. polythene sheet missing on the inner boxes and on the charger in the video 

3. registeration date of the laptop as per myasus app is september 02 2024 

4. warranty on asus website with s/n shows to end on 30th of august 2025 

5. i ran crystalmark on the laptop, found out that the laptop's ssd has active hours of operation of 217 hours which far exceeds me even having the laptop in my possession 

6. official asus ucs database showing that the laptop was brought in for rma in september 

7. cmd systeminfo indicates that the os was freshly installed on january 2025, the manufacturing is of july 2024. 

8. i did research on the laptop seller from flipkart. they are called smartlaptop7 on flipkart but on invoice their name is the overclockers, which i googled and found out they also go by the name of laptop station and all of their reviews say that they were being pursued into buying refurbished, used or oem products without warranties at retail price. (not really proof, but that's the root of the issue that flipkart won't acknowledge, they literally allow fraudulent sellers to operate on their platform and also defend them)",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"what happened to people who said they’re voting for dictatorship and infrastructure? its quite funny and sad at the same time to see bjp bhakts and ardent supporters fuming over the recent budget.

these people were the ones who said no problem even if inflation skyrockets , we will vote for modiji, even if fuel prices hit 500₹ / litre and a cylinder costs 5000₹..

what ever happened to the ultra nationalistic sentiment and pride these people chided in? what happened to people who said they’re voting for dictatorship and infrastructure? where are they?

why don’t they want to contribute to vikasit bharat? 

why are they unhappy in ram rajya?

why are they not content with their taxes being used to build international infrastructure and smart cities like that of pragati maidan, bharat mandapam, mumbai, delhi, ayodhya, airports and the engineering marvels of bridges in bihar, the engineering marvels of railway tracks and railways that they collide or go off track

arent they anti-nationals? and anyone who echoed slight criticism was rapidly and ruthlessly attacked and labelled anti-nationals.

**they deserve every bit of it and more but unfortunately cannot wish for it because in their quest towards strongman cultish dictatorship they will take everything and everyone down with them.**

oh the irony that if congress came to power they will raise taxes, bring in inheritance tax, take away your buffaloes, water taps, gold, flats etc, was the rhetoric during the election campaign

and lets remember, among bjp’s strong supporters are those urban class voters in large numbers too.

now someone in the comments will still have the audacity to say congress is worse, there is no alternative, and still believe in the false myths propagated by bjp about congress in general and its manifesto and etc etc.
 
i wont really spend time trying to combat your false myths about congress etc because its you have drank too much of bjp’s vikasit bharat and ultranationalistic pride akin to drinking magability kool-aid in the us. there’s a reason why such people are called andhbhakts.

if youre upset with the current tax raj, read up on congress’s manifesto on what they had proposed and you’ll find what you wish for now but unfortunately wont happen atleast for a few years or until the govt changes..*(i have tooo little hopes that those govt listens to feedback and outrage and protests and mend their ways or rollback certain proposals)*

and yes, congress has a ton of problems too, but ultimately its the lesser of two evils in politics unfortunately.

will write up criticism sometime soon about congress too. 

**the harsh truth is that the party that alleged what the congress led alliance would do, had they come to power, has itself done all those things,all while keeping people distracted from the main issues**",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"harrasment by cops on couples so, this happened recently and it still bothers me every day.

one fine evening, me and my girlfriend had just come back from a trip with friends. after reaching our area (nandini layout), we stopped at a food stall to have some chats to eat. then we left to go home, and it suddenly started raining — so we had to stop on a road (which apparently they call the ""officials area"").

because of the rain and the trek i did all day, i got a serious cramp in my leg and was trying to stretch it out. suddenly, a cop stopped by and asked, “what are you doing?” — and without even waiting, he started checking my pockets saying, ""thegi, gaanja aache"" (basically: “take out the stuff,” iykyk).

i told him, “check everything, sir. i don’t even smoke — why the hell would i do dr**gs?”
at this point, he hadn’t even noticed my girlfriend because it was dark, raining, and there was a power cut. i was standing a bit away from her.

then he told me to come with him for a medical checkup to prove i’m not on dr**gs.
i tried to explain: “sir, me and my girlfriend were just coming back from a trip. it started raining so we stopped here.”

then he started a whole new drama: “oh you guys are out at this time? (it was just around 7 pm) do your parents know? call your parents. let’s go to the station.”
i asked, “what did i do?”
he replied, “i know everything you guys do.”
funny part? we were literally meters away from each other when he stopped us. no pda, nothing.

at one point, he even started questioning us like, “why the hell do you guys even come to the officials area?”
i mean, is it a restricted place? isn’t it just a normal public road? we were literally just standing there because it started raining.


then my girlfriend started crying — a lot. i tried to calm her down and told her to just leave, i’ll handle it. but then he threatened: “if she leaves, i’ll call the hoysala (patrol car) and lock you in a dr**gs case.”
she got terrified and stayed, crying.

i kept pleading: “we didn’t do anything, please let us go.”
he grabbed my t-shirt so hard, i said, “sir, please leave my shirt.”
instead, he gripped it even tighter.
when i tried to free his hand, he slapped me so hard. “oh, you raised your hand on a policeman in uniform? you’re going to jail for sure.”
then he slapped me two more times, broke my metal watch, snatched my phone, forced me to unlock it, checked my gallery, and saw trek photos of us.

then he forced me to come to the station and call our parents. i kept insisting we didn’t do anything.
then he changed his tune: “okay, come to the station and pay the fine.”
i asked, “fine for what? we didn’t do anything.”
he said, “you raised your hand on a cop, etc. etc.”

i said, “no, i’m not coming to the station.”
all this while, my girlfriend was crying heavily but stood by me. i even tried to explain to him, “we’ve been in a relationship since childhood — 8 years. please don’t do this.”

then he said, “okay, give me the fine here and you can go.”
i asked how much.
he said, “₹10,000.”
i straight-up disagreed — it wasn’t possible.

all through this, i kept begging him to leave the girl; i said, “take me to the station if you want, but leave her.”
then he said, “₹5,000 will do.”
still too much, so i said, “i’ll give everything i have, but that’s it.”
the cash i had was in my girlfriend’s bag. i told her to give it, and she pulled out around ₹2,000.
she even tried to drop a ₹500 note to pick it up later, but he saw and asked for that too.
he took photos of both of us, even though she begged him not to, and took a photo of my two-wheeler. then finally, he left.


we both are born and brought up in bangalore, native to this city — yet we had to face something like this in our own area.
this whole thing was such a trauma for both of us.
we even stopped going on trips after that, thinking: if this could happen in a busy area inside the city, what if something like this happened while we were on a trek or somewhere remote where hardly anyone’s around?

i’m even thinking of turning this story into a short film, since i’m mostly into cinema.

has anyone here gone through something like this?
how did you guys handle it?",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"jayanagar is excellent! i moved from bellandur to jayanagar. it's the best decision i have ever made.

jayanagar has beautiful parks, trees everywhere, decent footpaths, fewer power cuts, soft cauvery water, inexpensive restaurants, cheaper rents, no water logging (due to higher elevation) and lesser traffic jams (thanks to grid square structure of roads).

the only problem is the travel time to office. if your office allows hybrid work for 2 days a week and offers flexible working hours, it's better to stay here. you can leave home before 7 am and leave office before 3 pm to avoid the peak traffic.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"bmtc reservation system for ladies - a couple of days back from itpl to silk board, i boarded the bmtc ac (switch) bus, the back seats were fully occupied. the back seat was occupied by a mixed crowd of ladies and gents. i noticed in the front, there were a couple of seats free. first, i hesitated to sit because sometimes the conductor will say it's a ladies' seat. then, after 30 minutes, i got a seat near the door (differently abled seat). within 5 minutes, i saw an elderly man boarding the bus, so i gave my seat to him, and that old man was so good that he was talking nicely. i had to stand in the middle end of the bus near the door, standing next to the elderly man. it was so rushed when it approached marathahalli. the young lady was standing next to me, saw me, and told the entire front and middle of the bus is reserved for women, men has to stand at the back. there was no space to stand, i kept quiet and distracted myself from that.

disclaimer: it's a new electric ac bus

today, on the same route, i boarded the same new electric ac bus. that time, almost all the ladies boarded the bus and occupied the backside of the bus. most of the men had no seats on the back side. but there were 5 to 6 seats free in the front ladies' section of the bus. most of the men were standing and travelling in the bus. i felt bad for those who were all standing. in that group of standing men, a person was asking for a ticket to silkboard from itpl. i felt bad for him a lot.

i don't know why this is happening a lot nowadays. even men are humans, they also have pain and all.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"got harassed by an ola auto driver hello fellow bangaloreans,

i wanted to share a horrid experience i had last night with a gunda auto wala(vehicle number-ka02 ac4309).

had booked an ola auto from hsr to whitefield at a certain price however upon arrival, the driver refused to accept my ride at that amount.
i cancelled and tried looking for other options. however, he kept standing next to me and was continuously trying to instigate me to fight him.i kept my cool and continued looking for other options. finally, i was able to book a rapido bike. to my horror, he warned me that he would beat the rapido driver and me.

since it was late in the night plus the crowd was dispersing, i started walking towards my nearest road junction i.e. bipin rawat chowk in hsr. he kept on following me all this time.

when my rapido arrived, this gunda removed the key from the rapido driver’s bike and started fighting with him.

this gunda called other gunda rickshaw walas and circled us. all this time, we were trying to get help from blr police force but the amount of back and forth we had to do just to register our problem was tiring and scary.

we held our ground and the police arrived after 15 minutes.we were taken to the hsr police station where they made us sit for 3 hours just to get our complaint registered.

that gunda driver had called his higher ups to make me take my case back but me and that rapido driver we didn’t budge.

the sub-inspector finally registered a formal case and gave a copy of my complaint.
he has called all of us today in the evening to bring this to his senior’s attention and provide a solution.
though i have made the decision of not rolling back my complaint, i am a bit scared for myself and my family members here.

these local goons have their own circle and may try to harm me and my family.
we travel quite frequently using all these apps and might come across their allies.
how to travel safely post all this?",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"my old activa’s is thirstier than i am in summer — anyone else faced this issue? so i ride a 2013 honda activa that’s been my trusty sidekick for over a decade. it’s carried me through college, late-night chai runs, rainy monsoon roads, and even the occasional “let’s see how many people we can fit on this seat” experiment.

but lately… it’s acting like it’s developed a drinking problem. i’m getting barely 30 km per litre, which feels insane for a scooter that used to be super reliable. what’s confusing is that there’s no fuel leakage when it’s parked — the tank isn’t mysteriously draining. it’s only when i’m riding that the petrol just disappears.

i even took it to the authorised service center, they have changed the air filter in normal servicing and they’ve already checked for leaks and gone as far as to change the carburettor— but the issue is still there.

now i’m stuck wondering: is this some deeper carburetor tuning drama, clogged air filter, spark plug mischief, or something else entirely? before i hand it over again and risk them blindly swapping parts, i’d love to know if anyone else has been through this exact phase with their activa (or any old scooter).

what did you try? what actually worked? would love to hear your stories (and maybe save my poor wallet from more petrol money 😅).

at this point, it honestly feels like i’m fueling a royal enfield bullet disguised as an activa🛵➡️🏍️💸.


**update**
recently i tried filling shell v-power petrol for ₹100, and i noticed something interesting — the fuel gauge actually showed a higher increment compared to when i had filled the same ₹100 worth of normal shell fuel. this makes me wonder if the quality/calibration of the regular fuel might be contributing to my activa’s abnormal mileage issue.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"i want to start cafe (bakery + eatery) without income source. 


how can i start a cafe (bakery + eatery + tap station [after 6 months]) without any income source. i have a degree of computer science engineering. and want to start a business in my city (tier 2). 

the business i want to start i already have two competition in my city.

background: i’m 23 years old, middle class. i don’t have capital to invest at all and after discussing with my parents they don’t have either (seriously they don’t).

my thoughts : i want to start this business on the basis of bank loans, at the moment of writing this i don’t have idea if bank provides loans for this kinds of projects or not. plus i think after taking rough estimates it will overall cost me around 30l, and the big problem is if i decide to use my home for that it is too small for this business and in crowded area and i don’t have owned place on road side nor a nearby farm. i live in middle of city so can’t go outside just to start a business, plus i will have to find a place where people are willing to come. 

big question: what i should do as of now to build this business? all i can think of is bank but is it possible to get 30 to 40l from them ? 

my thoughts on big question: there’s one way i thought but it will take lot of time, i’m planning to do ms in finance in usa (spring 2025) it will take like 2 years then i will get job there. then if i saved every month like 300k then only i can put my funds but that won’t be enough. and second way is if i grow my network and connections in vc’s then i can think of that business but then i will have to think of bigger one instead of this small one. 

what the fuck i should do i’m going crazy.
thank you for reading and responding i appreciate you guys support.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"why is it so hard to understand the importance of wearing a helmet? i have a good friend, we've known each other for years, recently came to his city and have been going out with him once in a while, problem's just the fact that he refuses to wear a helmet, and i find it very pissing and annoying that it's only me who's wearing it on his scooter because i value safety, and he brushes it off saying it's a small city, and not like bangalore where it's ""risky"", he hails from a tier 3 city, and we're living in tier 2 city, and i don't know how to put this in his head, that it doesn't really matter, we can't really assume it's gonna be safe on roads, and things are going to fine and nobody's going to crash in us, or we just won't ever an incident/accident.

it really sucks knowing what you're trying to do is make sure it's safe for others, while they just don't reciprocate and brush it off like it's nothing with dumb reasons like ""i've seen it with my eyes, people don't drive recklessly here unlike bangalore"", ""nobody wears it anyways"", ""this part of city doesn't have traffic police"". bc sahi hai taking life for granted, i don't know why i feel so agitated hearing all these excuses, and i am hell not driving again if he doesn't wear a helmet, or i am just gonna go with rapido, at least that way i'd have peace of mind.

tl;dr: my good friend refuses to wear a helmet, saying it's ""safe"" and ""okay"" in our small city as long as there's no traffic police. i value safety and his excuses annoy me that i've decided not to drive again with him unless he wears a helmet.",PseudoTopic_0

i have given up on bbmp and am moving to a new locality where i don't face this problem.

but since i have not been able to dispose these items, i have a build up of garbage in my room.

i need a service that can take these and dispose off. most of the services i see on justdial have [horrible reviews](https://jsdl.in/rsl-bfa1764665860) or paid fake reviews. i don't want to deal with goons and am looking better service.

does anyone know a service that can help with this??",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"does hindi unite or divide india? a reality check ! **let's look at history which shows u what happens when a certain policy takes place**

# pre-2024 (before nep 2020 push):

india, despite its diversity, remained largely united.

yes, there were internal state disputes (e.g., tamil nadu vs karnataka over cauvery), but these were isolated bilateral issues, not pan-regional unrest.

importantly, southern states like tamil nadu, kerala, karnataka, telangana, and maharashtra may have differed politically, but they did not display a collective resistance against the centre over anything big.

the overall national atmosphere was one of diversity and unity.

# post-2024 (nep 2020 implementation phase):

the push for hindi-centric education and administration under nep 2020 triggered strong, coordinated opposition from southern states.

the emphasis on hindi was perceived as:

a cultural imposition, a threat to regional languages and federal autonomy.

&gt;*^(for the first time in decades, multiple southern states found a common cause to resist the centre — not over water, not over finance, but over language identity.)*

let's look at states and their reaction when hindi was pushed one way or the other

# tamil nadu

1937 – compulsory hindi in schools--rajaji’s congress govt introduced compulsory hindi in madras presidency schools.

protests led by periyar &amp; the justice party. early dravidian mobilization. a strong messaging on “tamil self-respect” was started and set the ideological foundation for future anti-hindi movements.

1965 – official language act implementation -- centre’s move to make hindi the sole official language (replacing english).

protests erupted, massive, violent agitations by students &amp; public across tamil nadu, **with many sacrificing their lives.** “*hindi theriyathu poda*” — “*i don’t know hindi, get lost*” became a cultural resistance symbol.

this eventually led to constitutional amendment; english retained as associate official language.

# karnataka

2017 – namma metro signage controversy--hindi signs in bengaluru metro alongside kannada &amp; english citizens launched #nammametrohindibeda (no hindi in our metro) campaign and hindi signage was removed.

# west bengal

2018–2023 – central exams, nep push; hindi dominance in upsc, central education bodies, and nep 2020. strong political and intellectual opposition was triggered. cm mamata banerjee said “we have no problem with hindi, but don’t impose it. bengal reiterated its stand on bengali-first education &amp; governance.

# north-east states

2020–2022 – nep 2020 push--nep 2020 push to introduce hindi in schools and administrative roles. no public agitations but instead, governments officially requested exemption. demonstrating passive resistance and continued preference for english &amp; native tribal languages.

# maharashtra

ongoing – cultural and media space due to hindi dominance in media, film industry, and central hiring. raj thackeray (mns) and others have launched campaigns demanding marathi priority.“marathi mansa first” – “marathi people come first.” growing movement to protect marathi in public spaces and employment against hindi

# punjab

1950s–present – post-partition linguistic assertion, resistance to hindi being treated as default indian identity after partition. political movements emphasizing punjabi language rights. punjabi retained as official language, strong assertion in education &amp; administration.

# history speaks louder than slogans.

every time hindi has been pushed, india has seen resistance — sometimes silent, sometimes violent. from tamil nadu’s mass protests in 1965 to civil disobedience in karnataka and passive objections from the north-east, the pattern is clear:

***imposition breeds division and hatred***

but when hindi is not forced, indian states have remained **united, cooperative, and supportive** of the centre.

&gt;***from independence till today, india has stood strong without a common language, now india is divided because we push for a common language***

people often say, “*one language will unite us.*” but history tells another story:

&gt;***it is only when hindi is pushed that india fractures.***

so perhaps the truth is this:

&gt;***hindi doesn’t unite us — it divides us. and those who push it, knowingly or unknowingly, divide india. jai hind !***

as i write this saw another post that said ""language wars everywhere""...sad",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"do you think civil disobedience just like we had in the british raj will help in saving this nation?  there are multiple ways to manifest your emotions. i don't support any kind of violence against anyone in politics or government or any other authorities because it only makes matters worse. at the end of the day, political stability is the main key to economic progress. if there is no political stability in your nation, you're failure is inevitable. 

one of the key moments in india's struggle against the british was the civil disobedience moment. i've read a similar kind of a moment happened in iceland few decades ago when women came out and decided not to participate in household work or any other kind of work unless they weren't given equally treated and this worked well for icelandic women. 

considering the sad state of our country - pollution, garbage, joblessness, people dying of infrastructure fails, religious bigotry, rapes, all kinds of crime against women  etc. etc. - do you think to manifest your anger and frustration against the authorites, we should all go for civil disobedience. 

honestly, a moment like this in my opinion wouldn't have any effect in india, because the nation is more divided on caste, religion etc. than it has ever been. on top of that, because of our humungous population and a fucked up job market - people will always be willing to work since everyone needs to feed themselves and their families. 

what do you think? pragmatically is there a way we could tackle this - if not on a national level, atleast local or state levels..",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"is bbmp/gba really allowed to ask residents (each house in a locality) for ₹5,000 to fix a dug-up road? a friend of mine who lives near rv road told me bbmp/gba guys are asking him to pay ₹5,000 to “repair” a dug-up road in front of his house. 

no challan, no paperwork, straight-up demand. he already pays income tax and property tax, so why should he pay again for road restoration?

is this normal or is he getting scammed? how do we stop this (without getting harassed or killed)? 

when i checked with a relative living in another area, i got to know that they paid close to 5k too and was concerned, so thought i'll ask here.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"i come from a family of mango farmers curious how you buy your mangoes and what you look for how much do you pay and where you buy it from. so, i gave a box of mangoes to a friend who lives in the city because he’s a good friend. i didn’t expect how much he’d love them. he told me that he never had something like this before. during our conversation, i realized a lot of people, especially in cities, have very little idea about how mangoes are actually graded, priced or even judged for quality.



one common misconception is that black spots or lines on a mango mean it’s bad. this isn’t true in most cases. those black marks usually come from the sap that leaks out naturally when the mango is picked. it dries on the skin and might look odd, but it’s completely normal. the fruit inside is often perfectly ripe and delicious. yes, there are times when black spots are due to fungal infections like anthracnose, but even then, you can usually just cut out the affected part and eat the rest without a problem.



now coming to the actual market pricing in local apmc markets mangoes are graded and sold to traders or “veparis” who decide their fate. mangoes with a lot of black spots the lowest quality sell for about ₹600–₹800 per 20kg box. these mostly go to juice and pulp factories. slightly better looking ones still not very attractive go for ₹800–₹1100 and are often used for frozen mango products or canned mangoes.



then you have mangoes in the ₹1100–₹1300 range which are the lower-quality ones sold for eating. they aren’t necessarily bad but their quality depends heavily on the farmer. if the farmer hasn’t gone overboard with pesticides or water these can be decent.



now comes the real deal mangoes that sell between ₹1300–₹1900 per 20kg. these are the ones with slight dullness on the skin, a few black lines, but the taste is genuinely amazing. if the farmer knows what he’s doing these are as good as it gets. my own house mangoes usually fall in the ₹1500–₹2000 range during peak season. they might have some marks on the skin but their taste, texture and ripeness are top-tier. occasionally, you’ll get one or two perfect-looking ones with no black lines at all and that’s when you know the farmer really got it right.



above that, you have mangoes sold for ₹2000–₹2400 per 20kg which are usually meant for export to countries like the us or australia. but here’s the catch the export process kills the taste. to meet international safety standards, these mangoes are boiled, freeze-shocked and then passed through radiation tests. as a result, they might look flawless but the taste ends up flat, watery and sometimes even unpleasant.



to make mangoes look export-ready, some farmers go a step further. they use a high-pressure sprayer mixed with diluted car wash or cleaning chemicals to wash off sap and give the mangoes an artificial shine. if done once it’s usually fine. but when done excessively it damages the fruit’s natural skin layer and can be harmful. this is common among large scale exporters because only shiny mangoes pass visual checks for export. unfortunately, it’s all about appearance not taste or nutrition.



another thing don’t blindly trust big farmers. many of them use heavy chemicals and even things like car shampoo to shine their mangoes. if you want genuinely good mangoes, go to mid or small scale farmers. they’re more likely to care about the quality and taste over appearance. some farmers wrap mangoes with orange plastic or foam caps while they’re still growing on the tree. the goal is to prevent any dust, insects or natural marks from touching the skin so the mango looks spotless and shiny. while it works for appearance it actually kills the taste. when you block all natural elements like sunlight, breeze and even the occasional harmless insect contact the mango doesn’t ripen the way it should. these covered mangoes often end up looking perfect but tasting flat with less aroma and sweetness. it’s another example of choosing looks over flavor and that trade off is never worth it if you care about real mango taste.



now let’s talk about the kesar mangoes specifically from south gujarat. if you want the best-tasting kesar, look for mangoes grown in navsari or valsad districts. but not all parts of these districts produce the same quality. the east side has rocky, mountainous soil, and the west side is closer to the coast. in both cases, water availability is lower, which actually leads to better mangoes denser, more fibrous, less watery, and packed with flavor. these aren’t super sweet but are incredibly balanced and rich in taste.



that said the middle region where i’m from is often underrated. it tends to get slightly more water and if the farmer over-irrigates, the mangoes can become watery. but if the farmer manages it well, even the middle region can produce mangoes that rival the best. they’re a bit juicier but still carry that signature kesar flavor. the farmer’s skill makes all the difference here.



lastly, i got a bit sidetracked, but this rant started when i saw blinkit selling 500g of kesar for ₹100 that’s ₹4000 for 20kg. are people seriously buying at that price? when farm-fresh mangoes in peak season go for ₹1500–₹2000, that markup feels insane.



so let me know how much did you paid for yours.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"horrible experience with ola cabs and harassment from the driver. so, yesterday we booked a cab, the cab came to our apartment in horrible condition, it was raining and there was bad traffic, it took forever for us to reach due to bad traffic and due to rain, it was also night time, the cab was in extremely poor condition like it was very old and in completely bad state, after a lot of struggle, the driver reached to a particular location and said, that this is the location and please drop here, we told him that this is not the location, and he immediately started shouting and started behaving in rowdy manner, we were two women and two senior citizen and a small baby, we told him to take to the particular location and also told that we would pay him for that after arguing a lot that he has brought us to a wrong location and he was not agreeing, but he said he lost a drive due to us and that he won't take us to that location and also said we had to pay extra, we clearly told him this is not the location and that we had entered correct location and he was dropping us elsewhere, he told to get out of the car and that he doesn't want money, since he said he didn't want money and he dropped in wrong location, we dropped off and he started taking our picture, this was noticed by my family and then again he called telling that he will drop us to the right location, my family confronted him about taking the picture, he again started shouting and behaving in extremely rowdyish manner, i felt scared at his behaviour and started recording his video, he noticed that i was recording the video and decided that he will record the video and again started shouting, since ola doesn't have a phone number and we have to contact through messaging, we couldn't do anything as he was creating a scene, every second, when he started recording video, i felt damn scared the way he was behaving and opened the door in traffic, some auto passed there and there was sound, but nothing happened to me thankfully, noticing this he again started bullying and harassing us telling that we have damaged his car and came on road, my family and him started arguing and people around there started supporting us, the child started crying, telling that she is getting pain in her heart and feeling very scared due to rowdy behaviour of driver, also we were running here and there in rain as she was feeling unsafe near cab area due to fights where there was shade to protect from rain, that too in night time, i tried to contact some relatives for help, the people around tried to help us, he again started harassing telling let's go to station acting as though we did wrong to him and we paid a little extra money than what had come in app, due to his harassment. we left the place immediately booking auto ride from uber and rapido, and were in complete shock state due to his abuse that too women, senior citizen and kid, later we noticed that horrible problem with ola maps, that the location gets detected at two different places, one where, it actually is and one in some mall where it is not there. it was complete traumatizing feeling, and made us extremely unsafe during the ride. ola has deteriorated in quality, pathetic cabs, rowdy drivers, unsafe feeling, no customer support phone number. he asked to pay money in cash, and said he didn't have a scanner.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"quick commerce, quicker scam it all started at 4 pm today, scrolling through instagram, when a video popped up showcasing a mouthwatering chicken recipe. feeling inspired, i quickly ordered chicken from swiggy.   
  
true to their promise, it arrived within 10 minutes. ""wow, what efficiency!"", as my thoughts pass through, i was greeted not by the aroma of fresh chicken but by a rotten smell. the chicken was in such bad condition that even my dustbin seem like not a good place for it. frustrated but not shocked, yet another reminder of the quick commerce world, where zepto and bigbasket had also failed me before.  
  
determined to fix the issue, i contacted swiggy's customer care. that's where things got even worse. their proposed solution? ""we'll resolve this in 6 hours.""  six hours? then began a marathon of chats with different people from the supervisor to their senior, then to someone supposedly senior-er.. guess what? they all agreed unanimously: 6 hours. what was i supposed to do with this chicken for 6 hours? no answers.  
  
so, here we are, in a world where delivery takes 10 minutes, but solving the problem takes 6 hours. it's no longer a race to deliver first, it’s about who takes the longest to fix their disaster. now, i don’t know whom to blame, instagram for tempting me, swiggy for delivering garbage, or myself for falling for it? but, being a proud indian, i’ll just take the blame on myself, gear up, and cook dal curry and rice. after all, we indians excel in jugaad, even if it means turning frustration into a feast.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"khumbmela experience hi guys, i am sharing my experience during my recent trip to prayagraj and varanasi. as expected it was crowded and chaotic but definitely one of a kind of experience. we were four people, three of us started from hyderabad and one joined from delhi. over 3 days we visited prayagraj and varanasi. we had limited time with us so we just sticked to the main parts. as i have read and saw, one would need atleast 3-4 days in prayagraj to fully witness all the things. but not everyone has that luxury of time, so let's start with my experience.

note: make sure you carry sufficient cash as not all places have the digital pay option and be very cautious of your belongings. expect slow moving vehicles and be prepared to walk for kms.

day 1 feb 7th: hyderabad -&gt; lucknow ✈️ &amp; lucknow -&gt; prayagraj 💺
1. we reached to lucknow by flight first and took a metro to alambagh bus stand. metro is affordable, it costed 20/- per person. we were here by 11 am.
2. after reaching the bus stand, i went to ac booking counter and took a shatabdi bus, fare was around 390 /- per person. the destination was supposed to be civil lines bus stand in prayagraj.
3. but due to dynamic traffic restrictions i suppose our bus was halted at bela kachar bus stand. we reached here by 5 pm in the evening
4. from here we have shuttle buses to sangam area but they do not take us to the sangam, they stopped some where middle of the route to the sangam. these electric powered buses were highly crowded and ac was turned off at some point but due to passengers raising their voice they turned it back. it was the most frustrating 1 hour on the bus in my whole trip. i don't know what were the alternatives from that bus stand.
5. we walked for a while and caught a e-rickshaw to the sangam area, first he said he will drop us at nagvasuki temple but after paying extra, he dropped somewhere near to the bade hanuman temple. from there i guess it was 2-3 km walk i suppose. i guess we were at the starting point of sangam by 7:30 in the evening due to high traffic and thus slow moving vehicles. once you reach at the sangam area you could ask around for the ghat directions and it should be easy to follow, get ready to walk or pay some bikers who were charging around 200/- per person to drop at the ghat. khumb mela sure did brought a lot of business ideas :smile:
6. we had some light food as it was getting late already and then took holy dip in the sangam ghat.
7. after that we went to bade hanuman temple but they did not allow us inside the temple as it was late, i think around 10pm. so we did virtual darshan from the screens they arranged and started back to the room i booked on airbnb. it was near new bairahana petrol bunk. i booked here because i thought it was in the middle of civil lines and sangam area. we had to walk until main road as no autos were available. from main road we took an auto and reached our home stay. home owner was helpful.

day 2 feb 8th: prayagraj -&gt; varanasi 🚆
1. we first visited alopi bagh shakti peeth temple, which was near by from our place. we walked in 30 minutes. the temple was very lightly crowded so the darshan took less than 40 minutes.
2. we had some breakfast on the way back and prepared to start for varanasi.
3. luckily we had a vandebharat train available with seats, so booked them quickly and started to prayagraj junction. please reach to this station quickly as they are redirecting people from one gate to another. our train was on platform 6 some where far from where auto dropped us.
4. in couple of hours we reached to varanasi junction. from what i have understood banaras station is the one where we should drop off to visit the kasi viswanath temple. we first tried for some dormitories but they were all booked, so again booked an airbnb in mahmoorganj area. it was a little far from the temple but the rooms were a little more affordable. we reached here by auto which costed 250/-
5. we took some rest and started to the ghat first for evening harthi. because this was new place to us, we could not reach in time. harthi happens at all ghats i guess but dasashwmedh ghat is famous. we then decided to visit the kasi temple first but then stunned by the queue lines that were kilometers long. here we would be approached by multiple people who were saying they will help us with quick darshan for a cost of 1k per person. my mother had a number of a guy who charged 550/- per person and took us to towards gate number 2 of the temple. i personally did not like this at all as he will first take us to a shop where we had to buy parshad again costing money. they demanded every one of us have to buy the parshad but we argued and bought for 2 people. then this broker guy simply asked us to join the line some how cutting in the middle and as you would people standing back to us where not happy at all and even complained to the police standing nearby. all the police standing knew this business but still pushed us to the back. some how we entered the line after some struggle. get ready for this kind of experience when some body approaches you for ""quick darshan"" it took around 2-3 hours, so i suppose it is worth it as the free or normal darshan line was very huge. we came out around 9:30 or 10 pm in the night and visted vishalakshi temple which is near by. road to annapurna devi mandir was closed and we were told by some people that this temple can be visited only if we stand in the mainline, i don't know what is the gate number for the mainline as there were multiple ways to enter in to the temple.
6. we had some dinner nearby and started back to the homestay.

day 3 feb 9th: varanasi
1. we started around 9 am from room and had some breakfast and started for the kaala bhairav temple by auto. note that even when you catch auto you will not be dropped before the temple anywhere in varanasi. you either need to walk for 1-2 kms or catch cycle rickshaws which are charged 50-100 per person.
2. after 2 hours in the line (we cut the lines some times) we completed the darshan and started towards dashaswamedh ghat for pind pradhan, here you would need to negotiate for prices again. we paid 2100 *2 for two pind pradhan rituals.
3. then we took a group boat which costed 100 per person. there are private boats as well, but you need to negotiate the prices as they are just unreasonable prices quoted by these boat people.
4. we did some local shopping and noticed people were already sitting on the chairs available on the ghat by 1 or 2 pm. we did not know what these were at first but by evening i got to know they were seated for the evening harthi. we did not find a place at all to sit and watch and paid 300/- per person to be seated at the top of nearby houses. they said these were local standard rates. i was amazed by how the local people were creating businesses for themselves, they earn 5x or 10x my salary easily.
5. we had a decent view at harthi and it was really mesmerizing. i did not expect it to be that good but the huge crowd and chanting or singing songs all at once added to this other worldly experience.
6. harti started around 6:30 in the evening and continued for 40-50 minutes i guess.
7. we then had some dinner and tried some local street foods and went back to the room. 

this was the end of the journey for us as we had an afternoon flight from varanasi to hyderabad in the next day. although it was struggle at times reaching the destination, but once we arrived we forgot all those things and enjoyed the chaotic atmosphere. i saw people from various parts of the country and even from outside of our country and of all ages. be it kids carried by their parents or the elderly people who still want to experience this moment again even in their final stages of the life just adds that motivation that we can do it too. have a safe trip to khumb mela",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"""casual violence"" was watching arundhati roy's conversation with mehdi , centered around comparison between zionism and hindutva.

around the 30 minute mark roy spoke about the increase of ""casual violence"" akin to situations of mindless agression/rage that leads to harm to life. 

eg: person did not like that someone else parked their car in a particular spot so 1 killed 2. (you know this kind of acts exist. they are real. and they are increasing).

also increasing is the amount of insensitivity and apathy amongst people. there are so many reasons for it. politics  the 9pm news that feeds you false propaganda creates more rage and frustration, the actual problems- oil, gas, electricity, infra etc that no one pays attention to. competition,  paper leaks, the fact that the govt will rather spend money on cricket matches than honour victims of terrorism;  jail actual national heroes. so much more. 

in all this chaos, it is us the people who just want to live daily lives, are exhausted by work, by our economy,  our families that suffer the most. 

roy rightly said india has changed, it no longer ger feels like the home, the pride i carried as a child. it feels dirty not just from the blatant lack of civic sense but from these corrupt politicians and elites that have manufactured spectacularly a population of exhausted slaves that cannot and dare not care anymore. and then a few dogs that run on their command to keep those slaves docile.

what has been done to mr. wangchuk is a shameful blot on our democracy,  our constitution and our fundamental rights are citizens of india. yesterday it was manipur today it is ladakh. tomorrow it can be anyone's home town. it could be anyone you know. 

this is really the wake up call if we will ever get one. i hope more people can at keast become disillusioned now.",PseudoTopic_0

possible to add a ups for the fridge, so that it doesn't shutdown during power cut and then inverter can take over? if yes, what kind of specs should i look for in the fridge?",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"confused between hybrid solar setup and on grid+seperate inverter dear all,
ive been researching this topic and haven't found a satisfactory understand yet. i am planning to get a solar energy setup done with nullify my electricity bills(and earn more by exporting extra units if possible).

i have decided to get a 5kw capacity solar (~500w x 10 panels). my monthly usage is about 350 to 400 units. 

i had initially planned to get 5kw hybrid setup hoping that i would be able to run 1 ac (1.5ton) when there would be power cut, but the solar vendor told ac, geyser etc won't work with hybrid setup incase of power cut. 

in this case, the whole reason of going hybrid fails. if i have to just get backup for lighting (or lightweight appliances), i could just get on-grid solar of 5kw setup and another standalone inverter for powerbackup of maybe 3 kw. would this make more sense to keep solar and backup part seperate? 

another question is is there any advantage of use hybrid solar setup (battery + export to grid) compared to on grid + standalone inverter of same capacity?

i'm finding the latter option 5kw on grid + 5kw inverter costs around 60k less than 5kw hybrid solar setup.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"rental flat trouble i rented out a 1bhk unfurnished apartment in april. everything seemed okay in the beginning.

***1.. termite infestation on walls***

then i noticed a big termite infestation problem that had covered an entire room's wall and doorframe. landlord sent one of his local guys to check the issue and he came empty-handed and emptied my entire can of termite spray but didn't do anything further. now, after a month again the termites have come back. landlord agreed to get pest control done because this isn't just some furniture getting infested, an entire wall is gone. but even with this, there's been significant delay either because i've been away or the landlord's been out of the city.

***2. seepage &amp; wall paint***  
then after all the rains, the ceiling of the bathroom and kitchen started having major seepage. the walls are all swollen and chunks of paint are falling off. the same local person checked it out and said ""*ye kuch nahi hai. sookh jayega*."" (this is nothing. it will dry off.)

***3. water motor***  
there's only one supply of water to the house and that is through the water motor which i need to run in the morning and evening. i first faced an issue in july and even then the landlord refused to do anything. (his father had passed away and so had gone to the village. i didn't want to be disrespectful to a grieving person so i booked motor repair service from urbancompany). the person who came to fix the motor said that it will run temporarily but if again there's an issue then the whole motor will have to be opened up. in july at least the motor was switching on. just that there was no water going up. this time, the motor itself isn't getting switched on. the digits aren't moving.  
called up the landlord again and he says ""*toh main kya kar sakta hun? maine toh isko working condition mein diya tha*."" (so what can i do about it? i gave it to you in working condition.) he also says that he got the binding work done in november last year so how can it get spoilt so fast. i asked for bills of the work done and he says he doesn't have any and this work doesn't have any guarantee anyway.

my rental deed says i have until the 5th of every month to pay. but even if i miss paying on 1st by a day they immediately call up. for this, they are super quick but to solve the above issues they make it seem like they're doing me a favor. he even remarked saying that when he handed over the house it didn't have termites but he will still get it done anyway. he's out of the city for 15 days so he can't even come look at the place. he's someone who works as a contractor. he has 3 other flats in the same area that i am in supposedly. he doesn't live in delhi. he lives in greater noida.

i have always lived in furnished places where i've never faced such a thing. i don't know what to do about it. i have a lock-in period of 8 months as per my rental deed.

i can't spend on fixing the motor right now.

what would you do if you were in my situation?",PseudoTopic_0

8. all persons accompanying the body need to be dressed in full ppe in ambulances and cemeteries. 

9. collect copies of death certificate, note from bbmp doctor, nodal health officer and hospital. 

the doctors and administrative staff are really putting in their all to make this better for all of us. treat them with patience. it will take 5x longer than it needs to. the system is overburdened. allow for lax. 
wear a mask, ask friends for support.

reddit,"stop jugaad this independence day. india has always been known for jugaad or the uniquely indian philosophy of resourceful problem-solving and frugal innovation. it embodies the art of finding creative, low-cost solutions using whatever materials and resources are available, often in unconventional ways, just to get the job done.

however there is another angle to this *philosophy* \- that is to somehow get the job done one way or the other if the designated way to do it is costly in terms of time or effort or plain cost.

basically in other words, challenging the authority and breaking it just to get the job done.

examples of jugaad that don't generally come to mind:

1. not following the rules on the road - for example, riding the two-wheeler on the footpath meant for pedestrians - why ? because the roads are jammed, and why wait like everyone else ? ride on the footpath, ride on the opposite side of the road - because - the work has to be accomplished one way or the other. the fact that our road infrastructure is so poor and has not been able to keep up with the population explosion is unfortunately not a reason to break rules and somehow keep the show going on.
2. using sub-standard materials to get the job done - roads or bridges for example are classic examples of contractors using sub-standard materials or not confirming to construction standards in order to somehow get the job done in the available budget. this affects us in so many ways - people lose their lives but due to jugaad we have somehow made it happen using low-cost solutions. again i would agree that we don't have enough budgets, but instead of many substandard roads, can we not have a few standard roads and stop the jugaad ?
3. bribery - classic jugaad to jump queues and to get the job done - ""kuch jugaad ho sakta hai kya ?"" is an open invitation to bribery - whether it is getting your license done or getting away with traffic violation or pushing your files ahead - it is just unfortunate. why not just accept your mistake and pay the fine ? why not just wait for the right way to get things done ? i agree that if the government officials themselves ask for this, there is no other way for the common man to not bribe. it just reflects a very sad state of affairs. why doesn't the government upgrade its facilities to manage the scale problem ?
4. garbage disposal - indians are known to litter things around - because it is again too costly / not worth their time to find a dustbin - so just dump it in someplace where nobody is watching - perhaps on a corner or behind the tree or even dump it in a lake - anything but carry one's own garbage and dispose it correctly - the job must get done - jugaad / low-cost solution. why even segregate dry / wet / metal / bio-waste ? just dump it and someone will do it - easy ! this even extends to public urination - why bother to even find a public toilet ? low cost way to just urinate where nobody is watching.
5. adulteration in food - why bother building the right supply chain and logistics if one could inject chemicals into unripe fruits / vegetables or even go to the extent of artificially coloring them or mixing other adulterants in them - just to get the job done - easy low cost solution.

i can go on and on - but this is the attitude that is eroding us as a people. we need to stop this jugaad and demand the right way to do things, not take shortcuts, learn from the people who do it well and do the right jugaads - i.e. genuine optimisations without a loss in quality.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"my blr landlord is a fraud.  update 1

like most of the people in banglore i rent with my flatmate. yesterday, i got a call from my flatmate (since i am at my hometown) saying that there has been an issue in the building.
1. the electricity is cut since we haven't paid the bill. (ps: it was the owners responsibility to pay the july bill since we shifted on august 1st.)
2. the person that we finalized the deal with (let's call him mr. z) he is not the actual owner and the actual building owner (let's call him mr. r) has arrived. 

flash back to the day we were discussing our rental agreement 

so roommate and i were searching  apartments through a broker. the broker seemed genuine and pretty helpful. during the finalizations of agreement, we agreed that he would provide us a fully furnished apartment by 27th of july so that we can shift our belongings, so by the 1st of august the flat is livable. this discussions happened around 23 or 24th of july. he was suppose to do cabinet works in kitchen (since it was a co-live before). 

on july 29th we called him to ask about the progress and he said it will be ready by 31st and he is out of town and hence the work has slowed down. we agreed and gave him more time since we wanted to peacefully move in without much hassle. by this time we had already paid his deposit amount (1l) and signed the agreement for 11 months. 

during the packing process on the 31st, i called the owner asking him if all the work was done. he responded that bed frames will be ready in 2 hrs but cabinets are not done. (we were really starting to get frustrated at this point.) 

since we had already checked out of the previous house, we moved to this place. when we reached to our shock he had just started deep cleaning the house and we had to wait for 1 hr and get it done with helper he provided. 

the house did not have any furnishings as promised other than bed frames. we literally had to constantly nag him for everything. 

update 2

i called her back to ask for an update on the situation, and here is what she told me. 
1. mr. z is not the real owner. he had leased the property from mr. r. 
2. his lease was ending by august. 
3. he has taken money in advance for the apartments from various tenants and fled away.(he had asked us as well but we did not give him any money. we were saved. i'll describe ""the incident"" in detail below.) 
4. this guy is not picking up calls.

""the incident""

that particular day mr. z was very friendly towards us and built a good relationship. (so friendly we thought he wants to get into our pants. there was a creepy vibe about it. only later we knew why.) later that evening my flatmate went out with her boyfriend and i was alone at house. this guy bangs our door at 10:30 pm and asks if my flatmate is there and even when i said no he entered my home. i felt really unsafe about when he entered the house. he asked me if i can lend him 50k, there has been an emergency in the family to which i said no and then he started asking me to check if my flatmate has it. i told him i'll talk to her and he insited on me calling her right at that moment. i said i will let him know in an hour and he needed to leave. he kept calling me till 1am that night even though i had told him no. he called me again the next morning and i responded telling him that i have already said no. we do not have money and we rather pay rent monthly than right now for 2 months. this ended here. 

update 3 

1. mr. r has taken care of electricity issues of the property. 
2. he is making new rent agreements for all the tenants, keeping everything as is.
3. also we got to know that mr. z has taken bulk rent from 3 of apartment tenants, which add upto 23 l.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"smart cities? more like water parks funded by our taxes every damn year the same story. heavy rains in gurgaon, bangalore, mumbai, delhi ncr — and suddenly these “world-class cities” look like someone forgot to close the bathroom tap. roads turn into swimming pools, flyovers turn into waterfalls, and we taxpayers are left playing “urban flood simulator 2025” for free.

and let’s be clear — the people living in these cities are not freeloaders. they are the ones paying the highest direct taxes in the country. salaries taxed before they even see the money. on top of that, every single chai, every uber, every netflix subscription — indirect taxes galore. gst ka bhi gst dete hai hum.

but what do we get back? potholes disguised as roads. “smart city” promises that collapse the moment the sky sneezes. metro stations that flood like they’re auditioning for aquaman. and municipal “disaster management” that’s basically one guy with a bucket and a whatsapp group.

it’s not just about inconvenience — it’s the insult. people grinding 12-hour days, working in it, finance, startups, bpos — literally fueling india’s economy — and their reward is a free water park in front of their office gate. try explaining to your us client on zoom why you missed the call: “sorry sir, my car turned into a boat.”

and then every year the same circus: politicians show up with rolled-up trousers for photo-ops, hashtags trend, memes fly, and within a week everyone forgets. till the next rain comes. rinse and repeat.

at this point, the taxpayers of india’s big cities don’t need “smart cities.” they need basic dignity. a city that doesn’t crumble every monsoon. a road that doesn’t eat your car. a drainage system that isn’t 50% jugaad and 50% prayer.

but hey, as long as the money keeps flowing from our pockets, why would anyone fix the holes where the rainwater (and our hope) drains away?",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"what are some good things about living in indian cities? i am a 30-year-old male living in bangalore and working in an it firm. originally from a small town in north india, i am acutely aware of the numerous issues plaguing indian cities. overpopulation, high taxes, inadequate government services, severe inflation, subpar govt schools, poor infrastructure, insufficient healthcare, a lack of basic civic sense in people, communal tensions, extreme religious sentiments, crime, pollution, unemployment, and corrupt politicians are just a few of the challenges we face.

these issues have increasingly filled me with anger, affecting my daily mood, health, and relationships. the traffic and the sight of people disregarding basic rules infuriate me. i spend a lot of time watching foreign vlogs, creating an alternate reality to escape from my frustrations. this only intensifies my anger, as i see the common sense exhibited in other countries, which seems lacking here. everything about living in an indian city now triggers me. every pothole on the road, every politician, every government school, and the condition of the railways—everything triggers me now.

i don't have the option to move abroad due to family reasons, but i am desperate to escape this perpetual state of anger. it's taking a significant toll on me. i don't want to rely on foreign vlogs and videos as a temporary escape; it feels like a cheap dopamine fix that only exacerbates my frustration.

is there a way to overcome this? am i perhaps too ignorant of my country, overlooking its positives? one option might be to avoid living in big indian cities and move to smaller towns, but let's assume my job doesn't allow that. and it seems like a temporary fix because i will be part of same country.

what should i do? is there any way to not feel this angry all the time?",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"veeda v1 electric scooter shutting down while riding – need help! i bought a veeda v1 electric scooter during diwali 2024, and ever since then, it feels like i’ve brought home a headache instead of a scooter. almost every month, a new issue pops up.

but the biggest and most dangerous problem is that while riding, the scooter suddenly shuts down and stops, displaying ""safe mode"" on the screen. this has already caused me two accidents.

the first time, my scooter stopped suddenly, lost balance, and i fell, injuring my knee badly. there was bleeding, and i was in pain for days.

today, another accident happened. i was at a red light, and when it turned green, i moved forward, but the scooter suddenly shut down again. a bus from behind hit me because of this. the rear light broke, and i barely escaped with my life. if the bus had been moving any faster, i could have gone under it.


i have taken the scooter to the service center multiple times. they have replaced the motor, parts, and even the controller, but the issue is still not resolved. the technicians have tried everything they could, but they cannot fix this.

i don’t know what to do now. i regret buying this scooter.

has anyone else faced this issue with the veeda v1 or any other electric scooter? what should i do in this situation?
should i escalate this to higher authorities or take legal action? (i honestly don’t want to get into legal matters—i’ve never dealt with these things before.)

any help or advice would be really appreciated.

please help...!!",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"open letter to indian tourist from nepal  dear indians,

we recognize and appreciate our close cultural, traditional, and culinary connections, which make us see you as brothers and part of our extended family. however, we have noticed that many indian tourists do not adhere to appropriate ethics and values when visiting other countries, including nepal. 

it's disheartening to see issues like littering and loud behavior becoming prevalent among some of you. please remember to conduct yourselves respectfully when abroad. we are growing weary of the noise and the mess left behind. is common sense really that uncommon?

with the heat waves, many indians are traveling to nepal, often by road. the main concern is the disregard for local rules. do you realize the number of indian drivers facing violence due to their arrogance? the mindset of ""i paid money, so i can do anything"" is fostering animosity between nepalese and indians.

many of you arrive in buses, bringing all necessary materials and then cooking by the roadside. while we don’t mind this (though we encourage supporting local hotels), it is unacceptable to leave garbage behind. in nepal, there is a small fee of 10-20 nrs (5-10 ic) to use public toilets, yet many choose to relieve themselves roadside to avoid this fee. if you cannot afford to pay for basic amenities, why come to nepal at all? please do not treat our country like your own dumping ground.

while we remain grateful for the aid and support from india, the behavior of some tourists is creating resentment. let's strive to maintain the strong bond between our nations by respecting each other’s countries and following local rules and norms.

.........................

reddit,"why are women told to shrink in our country instead of men being told to behave? i recently made a post on my city’s subreddit, making it very clear that i am not offering myself to men just because i exist online or happen to be a girl, and that my presence is not an invitation. and yet, the exact thing i was calling out happened immediately after - my dms flooded.

men calling me an “attention seeker” and a whore. men demanding hookups or asking to “meet.” one even decided i must be a gold digger who only likes rich boys because “they can cover my expenses.” absolute garbage. and of course, these creeps don’t disappear - they keep lurking, commenting, posting, like parasites.

and instead of accountability, what’s the advice i get? just ignore it, close your dms, post less, stay in your limits. even educated men repeat this like it’s wisdom, when really it’s just cowardice. someone even suggested i should pretend to be a man online to avoid this hassle. do you hear how ridiculous that is? instead of telling men to stop being harassers, i’m supposed to erase my identity just to exist in peace?

yes, i’ve closed my dms. yes, i press ignore every time. but why is the burden always on women to shrink, hide, or change ourselves, while men roam around unchecked, harassing like it’s their birthright?

and it’s not just dms. recently, a guy even twisted a casual conversation about songs into me “liking him.” when i didn’t play along, he called me toxic. like… when the hell did that even happen? 🤡

this is the reality: women say “my presence is not an invitation,” and instead of respecting that, men double down. and society still tells us to adapt.

existing as a woman is not an open invitation. my life, my words, my posts are not an invitation . men need to get it through their thick skulls, the problem isn’t women existing, the problem is men who can’t handle a “no” without turning into creeps.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"we can no longer hide behind the excuse that we're a poor country our cities are filthy, unwalkable, extremely unaesthetic, and overall just a chaotic pile of things, people, animals, and dirt. go to almost any random street – broken roads, footpaths broken or just dirt/dust between the road and buildings, run down concrete structures with plastic/metal sheets hanging out, a little open drain here and there, garbage and dirt around. 

yes, india is still a low to lower middle income country. but of late, many indians have been going to similarly lower (middle) income countries in asia and africa and we have google street view everywhere. countries like vietnam have similar incomes as richer indian states (15-20k usd by ppp). but the cleanliness, urban spaces, as well as aesthetic sense are leagues ahead of anywhere in india. rwanda, a country much poorer than india, is becoming renowned for being extremely clean and safe. 

now you might say that these countries have authoritarian regimes and laws. singapore is another diverse asian country that became one of the richest in the world through draconian measures. so it seems democracy only works in homogeneous populations. 

until you consider mauritius. it's an island country where indians, chinese, africans, and some europeans were brought together and forced to mingle. half the population is hindu. it is now a high income country with advanced infrastructure and quality of life. and it's a democracy with a democracy index score above those of most european nations and the us. 

so low income or democracy in a diverse society is not what's stopping india from progressing. mindset is the only explanation. we're content to accept the deplorable conditions we have and focus on religious and ethnic divisions as well as moral outrage at trivial issues.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"a worker died in my neighborhood. this is the deplorable condition of workers in india. so this happened in my neighborhood today. two workers were fixing a lift in an apartment just a 5 floor building and the lift had water stuck underground since it’s near the park also because the drainage system here is a joke and we all know how delhi is actually flooded rn. now anyone with normal common sense would have turned off the electricity before sending people down there but nope these people didn’t. one poor guy got electrocuted and died instantly. the other was trapped with him in that lift for more than 3 hours before police and fire brigade could get them out. imagine being stuck there watching your co worker’s dead body lying next to you for hours. and here’s the part that made me rage even more there was no ambulance. none. although there were like 3 cars of police , even a fire brigade team, but didn't even call one ambulance .they just brought a dirty tempo like a small truck shoved the body inside and the surviving guy himself covered his dead friend with a white cloth. like what the fuck. that’s the “respect” they gave him. this is what it means to be a daily wage worker in india. no safety gear no basic precautions no dignity in life or in death. if it was a rich person from that same building the response would have been completely different ambulances doctors news channels everyone. but since it was a worker they just dumped him in a tempo and moved on. disgusting and heartbreaking. when are we going to start valuing every single human life the same.",PseudoTopic_0

due to an internal dispute between colive and the building owner, electricity has been disconnected today, while 7 days of my stay are still remaining.

i am currently left without accommodation, and colive has not refunded my deposit. their support team is non-responsive and the manager who showed me the room is not helping at all. i have filed a police complaint against the company and would proceed further if i get no response from them.

reddit,"the roads of bangalore are a complete nightmare – when will this end? bangalore’s roads have become nothing short of a deathtrap. specifically, the stretch from silk board towards eco space is absolutely horrendous! the service roads are filled with potholes so big, they could fit a 1bhk flat! and i’m not exaggerating. stones and debris are scattered everywhere, making it downright life-threatening to even drive or ride through these roads. one wrong move, and it could be fatal.

and the worst part? this is happening in a city where we pay some of the highest rto charges in the country! where does all that money even go? certainly not into fixing our roads. it’s infuriating to see that despite paying through the nose for vehicle registration, basic infrastructure is non-existent.

traffic here is already unbearable. it takes hours just to cover 5-6 kilometers. and to top it all off, when they finally do attempt to “fix” the roads, they just dump loose gravel into the potholes. there’s no actual repair work, no real effort to solve the problem. it’s clear the authorities know about this mess, but they just don’t care.

this is all a direct result of corruption in the bbmp and the utter negligence of our government. it’s mind-boggling how things can be this bad, and no one is held accountable.

at this point, it’s more than just frustrating – it’s saddening. every day, people struggle on these roads, just trying to go about their daily lives. watching this unfold is not only infuriating, but it also makes you wonder if anything will ever change in this city. is it too much to ask for basic infrastructure after paying so much in taxes and fees?

we deserve better.

ps: sorry but not sorry but the long rant after a wednesday office commute.

reddit,"[vent] people beating an innocent dog so there's a stray dog in our area that came from somewhere, and someone had put boiling water or something on him before coming here, his skin was burned and when he came here he had gotten a little bit better after eating trash, but then people started beating him trying to get rid of him because he would sometimes enter people's house looking for safety and shelter. someone people might ask why don't i adopt him, unfortunately i have a lot of problems and my circumstances won't allow. but that doggo never harmed anyone, he's very weak and frail and gets scared by people. i'm not saying those people should allow him in their house if they don't want to but why are you hurting a poor soul just for existing.

he's very skinny and now he has a broken leg, it seems that someone beat him really badly. i just saw him in front of our house trying to sit infront of neighbours house and he was looking here there for food and for a place to sit and he sat down after struggling with his broken leg and then run away when a kid approached him. some of the neighbours are my relatives and these assholes talk big religious shit and don't even have some empathy towards a poor dog and that vile women that is unfortunately one of my aunt would tell kids and teenagers to beat him and definitely also beat him. it's a small city so no animal support here. the worst thing is that despite how i feel about it, i can't do anything but to see him suffer, so i guess that doesn't make me any better than those people. i'm mad at myself and this cruel world. i don't feel like living in this world anymore, it's just too much, and my health issues makes me feel even more shitty. sorry, just wanted to get this off my chest.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"suggestions needed: what small business could i run from my home shop? hi everyone,

i’m exploring new ideas for a small business in our family’s 10x20 ft shop in delhi, right across from two government schools and next to an mcd colony. my parents used to run a grocery store here, but the footfall has gone down lately due to online grocery apps, and they’re thinking of either renting it out or repurposing it.

the shop has:

* steady school footfall
* local residents from the colony
* people from nearby well-off colony
* several gyms nearby
* 50 sq ft extra storage space
* electricity, with plumbing possible

my parents can supervise day-to-day operations, and i can hire 1–2 staff if needed. i want to build something practical, ideally with good margins and steady demand, but not overly complex to manage.

**i’d really value your suggestions on:**

* what kind of business would fit best in this area?
* what products or services do you think would sell well here?
* any challenges or lessons i should keep in mind before investing?

open to any creative or realistic ideas — i don’t want to get stuck in the same middle-class grocery routine if there’s a better opportunity. thanks so much for your thoughts, delhi! 🙏

**tl;dr:** family shop (10x20 ft, near schools and colony) needs a new small business idea. parents can help supervise. open to suggestions for practical, steady-income businesses instead of the old grocery format.",PseudoTopic_0

why do our people keep doing this? isn’t it disrespectful to our gods to have their images left on a roadside like this? it’s dusty, exposed, and bound to cause unnecessary problems.

why don’t the authorities stop this before it becomes a full-blown issue? there must be better ways to show devotion that don’t involve creating safety risks or complicating urban planning. what are your thoughts?",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"title: successfully retrieved deposit from fraud landlord in bangalore - a must-read for newcomers and tenants! hey bangalore tenants community,

i wanted to share an experience that my sister and i had with a fraud landlord in green glenn layout, belandur, bangalore. this is especially important for all newcomers and tenants who might find themselves in similar situations.

**the background:** my sister rented a flat in green glenn layout last year. a significant red flag was that a single owner owned all 15 apartments in the building, managed through an agent. tenants had no direct contact with the owner, only a bank account number for rent deposits. the rental agreement was dropped off at the doorstep after being signed by the owner, and all communication went through the agent.

**the issue:** from january, the entire apartment faced water problems, with water available only for 2 hours a day. my sister discovered this was a tactic to force tenants out so the flats could be rented at higher prices. on the day my sister gave her one-month notice to move out, the water problem was miraculously fixed, and the agent finalized a new tenant at a 30% higher rent. the real harassment began when my sister asked about the return of her deposit. the agent stated that it would start ""processing"" one week after returning the key, with no committed return date.

**the plan:** sensing trouble, my sister contacted the previous tenant, who revealed that the landlord was a habitual fraudster. the previous tenant was harassed for two months before getting back only 60% of her deposit, with 40% deducted for unknown reasons. determined to avoid this fate, we took action.

**steps taken:**

1. **written notice:** we sent a letter to the owner (address found in the agreement), clearly stating the notice period and highlighting the clause that the deposit should be returned upon leaving the flat. we emphasized that withholding the money would be illegal and a breach of contract.
2. **legal threat:** we hinted to the agent that we were collecting evidence for the police or civil court, mentioning our prior experience with legal proceedings.
3. **tenant alliance:** we spoke with other tenants and discovered similar issues with the landlord. we formed a whatsapp group to gather evidence and present a united front.
4. **securing the flat:** when moving out, we locked the flat with two big chains and attached a notice stating that any attempt to break the lock or trespass would result in criminal charges (ipc 441 and 447) until the deposit was returned. we made it clear the flat legally remained with my sister.

**the outcome:** the next day, the agent called with a much softer tone, claiming they had never cheated any tenants. eventually, the owner agreed to a joint visit to the flat, and my sister received her full deposit back.

**key points to remember:**

1. **agreement clause:** ensure your rental agreement states that the security deposit will be returned at the time of leaving the flat and handing over the key.
2. **gather proof:** work together with other tenants and collect evidence.
3. **secure the apartment:** don't hand over the key until the deposit is returned. secure the flat to prevent unauthorized entry.
4. **legal options:** consider legal action if necessary. civil court costs include notice (₹5k), filing (₹20k), and per appearance (₹3k).

lastly, use resources like chatgpt to draft your notices and letters. don’t be afraid to stand up for your rights; not every owner is politically connected, and not every police officer is biased against outsiders.

stay vigilant and protect your rights!",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"fed up with trash dumping in every corner of the city i don’t know when this city is going to take garbage management seriously. every 2 to 3 kms i spot a pile of trash just sitting on the side of the road. it’s not one area here and there, it’s all over. bellandur, sarjapur road, even the so-called developed parts look like dumping zones half the time.

there are no garbage bins provided by the government anywhere. people have no option other than throwing their waste in random corners, and then everyone pretends like it’s normal. on top of that the roads are in terrible condition. potholes, dust and garbage all in the same stretch.

i’ve been living in bangalore for 2 to 3 years now and literally nothing has changed on this front. it’s annoying to pay taxes and be told this is one of the top cities in the country when the basic cleanliness is missing. i’m just tired of seeing this mess everywhere and nobody in authority seems to care.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"hindu khatre mein hai! hindu khatre mein hai because:

in november 2025, the supreme court narrowed the definition of the aravalli range. only land that rises at least 100 meters above nearby areas now counts as aravalli. in plain terms, this conveniently clears the way for large scale mining to resume. the result will be severe ecological damage to the natural barrier that protects north india.

hindu khatre mein hai because:

in 2021, lakshmi organic industries, owned by the goenka family, set up a company in italy to acquire miteni spa. miteni was shut down after one of europe’s biggest environmental scandals. it was found to be releasing dangerous forever chemicals known as pfas. around three to three and a half lakh people were affected.

lakshmi organics acquired the plant, technology, patents and production methods. the same chemicals are now planned to be produced at lote parshuram midc in ratnagiri. same process, new location, same risks.

hindu khatre mein hai because:

on 21 december 2025, the president approved the shanti bill. it was passed by parliament without detailed scrutiny by a joint parliamentary committee.

the bill opens nuclear power to private companies while limiting their liability for accidents to rs. 3000 crore. for context, the fukushima disaster cost nearly 200 billion dollars.

worse, affected citizens, activists and even state governments cannot directly file cases or claim compensation. everything must go through a central government appointed claims commissioner. criminal cases against private operators are also restricted. regular courts are off limits. special tribunals controlled by the centre will decide everything.

if a disaster larger than bhopal happens, people will have nowhere to turn.

almost immediately after the bill was cleared, adani enterprises began discussions with the uttar pradesh government for a commercial nuclear project. make of that what you will.

hindu khatre mein hai because:

the bombay high court has allowed the removal of over 45,000 mangroves for the versova bhayander coastal road.

more than 1800 trees were set to be cut in tapovan, nashik for preparations for the 2027 kumbh mela.

hindu khatre mein hai because:

air quality across india is collapsing.

delhi stands at 309.

mumbai at 131.

pune at 155.

kolkata at 231.

in parts of up, punjab and haryana, the numbers are even worse.

khalilabad 513.

gorakhpur 434.

kapurthala 425.

jhajjar 404.

karnal 393.

this is not politics. this is survival. if you stay asleep much longer, you might not wake up at all.

so once again,

hindu khatre mein hai

i support development. but development that leaves future generations sick, poisoned and powerless is not progress. it is negligence with good branding.

and for those asking why i say hindu and not muslim or christian, i follow mohan bhagwat’s view. anyone born in india is a hindu, regardless of religion.😎

so yes. everyone is included.

reddit,"“i don’t hate dogs — but my right to sleep and move freely is gone because of irresponsible ‘dog lovers’ next door.” before anyone judges me — no, i don’t hate dogs and i’ve never harmed one. but i honestly don’t know whose rights come first anymore — the dogs’ or the humans’ fundamental rights to sleep peacefully and move freely in their own street.

i’m writing this at 6 a.m. out of sheer frustration. we live in a decent neighbourhood — or at least it used to be. there are a few empty plots everyone uses for parking and kids playing. my father’s best friend lives next door with his unemployed son, daughter, and wife. they have plenty of free time, act like the biggest dog lovers, but are rude to elders and talk behind everyone’s back.

about 3–4 years ago, some stray dogs started hanging around. this family began feeding them, and now the dogs treat the whole street like their personal territory. the couple claims they “keep the dogs outside at night for safety,” but in reality, they chain or lock them in empty plots or keep them indoors. the dogs cry through the night, and around 5:30 a.m. they release them — right when milkmen, maids, and walkers come out.

several people have been chased or bitten, yet they always say “they don’t bite” or “they just didn’t recognize you.” from their balcony, they’ll shout “kallu, stop!” while the dog runs after someone — as if that magically helps.

when neighbours held a small meeting, most people spoke sweetly like “we’re not against dogs, but this is getting out of hand,” but behind their backs everyone agreed it’s completely wrong. only my parents and one elderly lady spoke openly. that lady was rudely told by the dog lover’s wife, “aapne apne bachon ko sanskaar nahi diye — you’re speaking against dogs!” since when is asking for safety a sign of bad upbringing?

here’s the irony: the same uncle who calls himself an animal lover beats cows and buffaloes with a stick if they enter the lane, but worships dogs like gods. their “dog love” is more like a showcase — i’ll keep them when i want, release them when i want, but if they bite or chase someone, it’s not my fault because they’re ‘awaara’.

they’ve even started telling street vendors, kabadiwalas, and beggars not to enter the street, saying “if anything happens, not our problem.” what about their right to work and move freely? they literally laugh when dogs chase people.

we had to soundproof our room because of constant barking. these dogs aren’t trained — just territorial and aggressive because of how they’re treated. i’ve seen other stray dogs in nearby streets who are calm and non-violent because they aren’t made to feel like they “own” the place.

now every guest who visits has to inform us first, and we walk them out to the main road to make sure the dogs don’t run after them. it’s honestly dadagiri — their love, our loss.

it’s always the same story: our love, our freedom — your responsibility.
they claim to be dog lovers but take no responsibility when someone is bitten, scared, or can’t sleep at night.

i respect genuine dog lovers who care responsibly. but this is pure selfishness disguised as compassion — and it’s costing people their peace, safety, and fundamental rights.

sorry for venting, but i’m exhausted. what can i actually do — legally or practically? i can’t wear earplugs forever or adjust my entire life around their dogs’ schedule.
love for animals shouldn’t mean cruelty towards humans.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"is tesla’s entry in india overhyped? the real impact of lower import tariffs i see a lot of excitement about tesla’s potential entry into india due to reduced import tariffs, along with praise for trump’s reciprocal tariff policy. but is this really good for india’s economy and manufacturing sector?

if we lower import tariffs across the board, it won’t just bring “competition” for indian brands—it could kill them. why? because companies won’t feel the need to set up manufacturing or assembly units in india anymore. instead, they’ll just import from china, vietnam, or other low-cost countries, undercutting local brands like tata, mahindra (born electric), and others.

the impact? fewer factories, fewer jobs, and more reliance on foreign-made products—completely going against the make in india and made in india initiatives. with our population growing, do we really want to risk reducing job opportunities in manufacturing?

also, is tesla’s entry really that big of a deal? we already have solid ev options from tata and mahindra. tesla isn’t magically solving ev infrastructure problems in india either—charging stations, grid readiness, and affordability remain key challenges.

are we overhyping tesla while ignoring the bigger economic consequences? would love to hear your thoughts!

reddit,"please don't make of kashmir what you have made of shimla/manali dear tourists,

as a kashmiri, i welcome you to visit the famous dal lake, the meadows of gulmarg, lidder valley in pahalgam, and other places in kashmir that you want. for one, it brings a lot of revenue for local businesses. even though i don't have an occupation related to tourism, many of my friends and family benefit from it and i welcome everyone.

but, please stop with the littering and have some civic sense.

dal lake was my go to for cycling every evening but now i've stopped it. i don't feel like going there because of the heaps of garbage around the banks of the lake, and floating food wrappers and other plastic waste in the lake. it's a common sight to see dl, hr and gj cars parked on the footpath around the lake's perimeter blocking path for pedestrians and cyclists.

even at places like gulmarg, pahalgam and sonmarg, the ecosystem is dying and it's common to see cars parked on river beds at some places with heaps of garbage around it. if you can carry packaged food and other stuff in your cars to the mountains, you can most certainly bring it back in the same car.

as a kashmiri, it is very saddening to see all this happening to the place i call home.

all this combined with the short sighted growth plan of current cebtral government has taken a toll on kashmir's ecosystem. the current push to tourism has resulted in hundreds of acres of forest land being cleared for hotels and other 'development' projects around boulevard road, doodhpathri, gurez and other places. that is something kashmiris feel helpless about and that is a topic for a long and detailed article.

but atleast as tourists, you can be more sensible and not make the place you visit a hell for the locals.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"please help me find a simple power backup solution for my onu + router. ups won't work due to low load cutoff, mini ups won't work because two devices. hi,

here's the situation - i want a backup solution that lets my onu and router run during power cuts. power cuts here don't last very long, so if it can just manage 30 mins, that will be fine. onu is 12v 0.5a and router is 12v 1a so total is not even 20w. just for reference, both of these have power cables that are integrated with the adapter/plug - the cords are not removable, if they were, i could plug it into some 12v battery or something somehow.

problem: most upss on the market have a poorly documented low load cutoff. it is rarely mentioned what the cut off exactly is, but it's definitely well above 20w, it's usually around 50w or something. so it shuts off if the only thing it's powering are those small things.

there are mini upses on the market meant specifically for routers. those have only one dc output - for the router. so my onu won't run which makes it pointless.

potential solutions i can think of:

1) buy two mini upses. seems an awful waste.

2) buy a ups without a low load cutoff. can't seem to find any that definitely don't have this.

3) artifically add some load to a ups to get past the low load cutoff. can't think of any elegant/cheap way to do so. 

any help would be greatly appreciated. thank you!",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"my dreadful experience in colive capetown near global tech park i moved into colive capetown, bangalore pg last year because i kept getting calls from them their sales team saying it’s the best pg. me being clueless checked google to see that it has 4.5 stars and didn’t think much of it.(i’ll get back to this later on) so i joined the pg, i paid - 1 months rent(6k), onboarding fee(1.5) , platform fee and deposit(9k which is quite high for any pg in the area, all other pgs charge 3k max) now this is where the nightmare starts- there was no hot water the whole time while i stayed there 3 months, outrageous electricity and water bill( which i was told will be 300 per person, but ended up being 800 to 900, even in the month when no one was in the room) no power backup(lost power for a few hours a couple of days), tasteless food with insects in it, fan that wasn’t working properly when i joined but i had to pay from my own pocket for it to be repaired, a rude and uncivilised receptionist who refused to give me his managers number when i had an issue with something, unclean lobby, small dingy rooms with no air circulation( i have a bit of wheezing, and i’ve lived in more smaller and closed rooms but here i started having breathing issues, because the building is tightly packed with the other building in the area), theft of money, they don’t return your deposit back and the list just goes on.

my biggest mistake was not reading the google reviews , even though it shows 4.5 stars , always the first review is 1 star review speaking of how they have been treated and  scammed by colive. when i was joining the pg they forced me to give a 5 star with a description saying how good it is. this has been by far the worst experience in my life from a pg. i have luckily recorded a few of incidents just in case i have to use it against them someday. but this place is a literal nightmare, i’m writing this post soo that no one joins this scam of a pg. the moral is - don’t ever sign up for anything related to colive cuz everyone has been scammed one way or another.

do any of y’all have any such stories? educate everyone in the comments.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"the struggles of moving offices in “digital india” 
i recently shifted my office to a new location, but the experience of dealing with our so-called “digital india” systems left me in an endless bureaucratic loop. here’s the situation:
	1.	new property, new issues:
the new property was recently purchased by the landlord, and i rented it right after. while shifting and completing legal formalities, i realized the landlord’s name on the electricity bill was still the previous owner’s. this became a massive obstacle.
	2.	bank’s requirements:
to update my address for my current account, the bank demanded a gst certificate with the updated address. fair enough.
	3.	gst portal nightmare:
i raised a request on the gst portal to update my address, attaching the new rent agreement and the electricity bill (which still had the previous landlord’s name). i even provided proof of sale showing the new landlord’s ownership. despite this, the gst officer rejected the request, claiming the rent agreement didn’t match the electricity bill.
	4.	electricity department’s digital maze:
i then approached the electricity department to get the landlord’s name updated on the bill. but guess what? they told me everything is digitized now—no physical help is available. i had to do it online.
	5.	endless rejections:
i submitted all necessary documents online, but the system kept rejecting my requests. it felt like whoever was reviewing the case wasn’t reading my submissions properly or didn’t understand the urgency. worse, there’s no way to communicate directly with the person rejecting it or even understand the exact grounds for rejection.
	6.	the big takeaway:
this is where “digital india” fails. while digitization has its benefits, the lack of physical support for unique or urgent cases is a huge problem. not everyone’s issue fits neatly into an automated system. sometimes, human intervention is necessary to sort out discrepancies.

has anyone else been through something similar? how do you deal with these endless loops in a system that feels like it’s designed to reject instead of resolve? i’d love to hear if anyone has tips or a workaround for this.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"stanza living hsr – no security deposit refund after 4 months. anyone else facing this? hi folks,
posting here in frustration and in the hope that someone might be able to help or has gone through something similar.

i stayed at a stanza living property in hsr layout, bangalore and vacated the flat nearly 4 months ago. as per their rental agreement, the security deposit was to be refunded within 45 days. it’s been over 96 days now, and i’ve still not received the refund.

despite multiple emails, app support tickets, calls to the property manager, and even raising a complaint on the national consumer grievance portal.

to add to the mess:
	•	the app shows false deductions for damages (even though the property was handed back in perfect condition).
	•	during the stay, we faced frequent power cuts, no water for bathing, lifts that barely worked, a constantly broken washing machine, and spotty wifi — all while paying full rent on time every month.

i have all the supporting documentation:
	•	agreement
	•	email trails

is anyone else facing similar issues with stanza living?

thanks in advance. posting this so others don’t fall for the same experience.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"sometimes it's hard to love bangalore.. last week, my scooter had a breakdown and the nearest service centre to me was kms away..so i decided i'd push my scooter instead of getting it towed cause i was broke af and i had aldready applied for a sick leave after the breakdown..
i thought it would be fun to just, push my scooter and just take time to breathe in the city air..
i saw many things while i pushed around; people on their bikes driving to work, school kids, vegetable vendors setting up shop, traffic police trying their best to navigate the insane amount of bangalore traffic..
it was very weird because it was the same places i used to be around, and the people were also the same but something was just not right..it made me a little uneasy 
i had turned a blind eye to so many things that happen in bangalore and i had it normalised so much that it felt a little shocking..
areas with trees which still couldn't handle the amount of pollution and dust..the garbage that's casually laying around collecting dust for months..so many people just spitting on the road while waiting in traffic..it made me repulse a bit..
i feel like people have gotten so used to things just working a little disfunctional so much so that when you experience something normal, it seems like a privilege..
anyways my path eventually lead up to chamrajpet, where i came across this..
all the stuff i experienced that day made me realise it was getting harder and harder to love and accept the city i once loved..
bengaluru has so many great aspects and things that were working right for it..the culture, the people, the trees, the weather, the passion, the birds, the dosas, the peace..
the more the population grew, the more the trash along with it..so i'm wondering how lack of awareness can be so prevalent in a city filled with so much knowledge and so much information..we are living in the most widespreading news and information era of humans and yet the trash continues to grow..",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"new scam alert @ hsr havmour ice-cream noticed something super weird today at hsr 14th main road, sector 7 now. 


there were 4 havmour ice-cream carts on the street all spread out and guess what none of them had mrp price written on them. all the ice creams (literally every piece, every sku) had mrp price being deliberately removed or scratched off. 


when, i asked the first vendor he conveniently pretended that he had no idea why this was the case. he blamed it on the supplier and said he just sells. not being convinced, i felt i was being scammed with the inflated pricing for the ice-cream i decided to move ahead. this is when i saw another vendor, same stuff happened with the pricing. but this time the excuse was very straightforward - prices are cut out because i want to sell it at 5rs above mrp for.labour, cooling and so forth. i was convinced some shady stuff is being masterminded here. 

to my curiosity, i wanted to see if this was a one of case or literally everyone is doing this. i saw 2 more carts ahead on the same road and deliberately stopped to inquire the pricing. 

guess what all 3 vendors had a different pricing for the same ice-cream? i was like duh what is going on? 40?50?60rs? for the same icecream.

 when i confronted the last vendor about this aggressively he became defensive and started arguing back. i could see him getting agitated but he couldn't care less if i caught them. typical screw you attitude ""do what you can"". 

not that i have a problem paying 10rs extra or  whatever but the fact they have audacity to do it with a brand like havmour was outrageous. 

headups to everyone! don't understand why vendors in bangalore try  to scam at any moment? i admire this city so much but then this happens. 

can we report this to the right authorities? who will be in this case? 

peace",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"feel really powerless given the ongoing issues in the country we are nearing the end of 2024 but our cities are filled with problems which should have been solved years ago.

our rules are outdated  
\- poor fsi regulations which no one seems to care about  
\- reservation which was supposed to be removed has actually increased (not saying it's bad but it should be updated keeping in mind the new dynamics of the country)  
\- alimony rules and regulations are now being used to harass men (in few cases but still an important issue)

our government is filled with corruption  
\- take any department in general and you can find cases of bribery, preferring their own etc  
\- 2% population is burdened with the highest tax  
\- this set of people are paying taxes more than once on the same income  
\- roads/infrastructure is sooo poor  
\- delhi is burning  
\- unemployment is rampant in the youth  
\- basic things in life like house, transport, education are becoming unaffordable by the day

what can we as citizens do about solving/tacking these issue? 

i have tried thinking about how can we use tech to solve these issues? maybe a platform where you can anonymously complain about certain people who are asking for bribe with details? but how do you solve for fake complaints? and who is responsible to look into this? 

i don't think sitting and cribbing is the only thing we can do. we need to do better.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"budget 2024: a superficial fix that favors the elite 
in the wake of finance minister nirmala sitharaman's recent budget announcement, it’s evident that while the budget ostensibly aims to address critical issues like rural development, employment, and infrastructure, it fundamentally misses the mark on tackling the deep-rooted economic inequalities and systemic exploitation entrenched in our capitalist framework. despite appearing to offer solutions, the budget ultimately serves to fortify existing power structures, benefiting corporate interests at the expense of the working class and marginalized communities.

one of the most talked-about changes is the increased tax on long-term and short-term capital gains. raising the tax on long-term gains to 12.5% and short-term gains to 20% is a superficial gesture. this modest increase does little to disrupt the vast fortunes amassed through financial markets. it’s a symbolic move that placates critics without significantly affecting the elite investors who continue to thrive in a system designed to favor their wealth accumulation over societal welfare.

the much-publicized $24 billion job creation plan is another area where the budget falls short. this plan relies heavily on market mechanisms and incentives for the formal sector, such as direct cash transfers to first-time job entrants and manufacturing job incentives. however, these measures offer temporary relief and fail to address the structural unemployment and underemployment plaguing the nation. they perpetuate a cycle of precarious work and low wages rather than creating sustainable, meaningful employment opportunities.

tax relief for start-ups, the middle class, and foreign corporates further underscores the budget’s capitalist bias. the abolition of the angel tax and the reduction of corporate tax for foreign companies from 40% to 35% clearly prioritize corporate interests over public welfare. these tax cuts are unlikely to result in significant job creation or economic benefits for the majority of indians, enriching a small, already privileged segment of society instead.

the financial support allocated to bjp’s regional allies in andhra pradesh and bihar is a transparent political move. it seeks to secure loyalty and support rather than addressing the genuine developmental needs of these regions. while infrastructure projects are necessary, the allocation of funds here is driven by political expediency, not a coherent and equitable development strategy.

moreover, the reduced budget deficit, heralded as a fiscal success, is achieved through a significant dividend payout from the central bank rather than any substantial economic policy shift. this approach underscores the government’s short-term fiscal management focus, prioritizing immediate appearances over long-term financial stability and social equity.

finally, maintaining the state-led capital expenditure on infrastructure at the same level as the interim budget reveals a lack of genuine commitment to transformative economic policies. although the focus has diversified to include areas like employment, small businesses, and social welfare, these efforts are insufficient in addressing the deep-seated inequalities and systemic issues within the indian economy.

in essence, while this budget makes some nods toward social welfare and employment, it fundamentally fails to challenge the capitalist structures that perpetuate inequality and exploitation. it reinforces the interests of the corporate elite and political allies, leaving the working class and marginalized communities to continue bearing the brunt of systemic injustices. a truly transformative budget would prioritize wealth redistribution, robust structural employment programs, and comprehensive social welfare systems, ensuring economic growth benefits all sections of society, not just the privileged few.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"last post went viral. i have taken up a mission to  make india clean and have already started being successful. around two weeks back i shared how i cleaned a small part of my town all by myself. that [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1ml3p9p/one_of_my_friends_from_the_us_had_me_embarrassed/) received a surprisingly positive response. since then, i’ve been fired up.

now, before i tell you what happened next, let me make one thing clear. i know this is not easy. i know i’ll have to deal with babus, garbage mafias, endless red tape, and people who don’t care. i know most indians lack civic sense. i know it’s a long road.

but despite all of that, i will keep working. i will keep trying. because i have also discovered something powerful: there are still good people out there. people who are not corrupt. people who are ready to help. people who are angry about the state of their cities and want change.

so, i started small. small enough that i wouldn’t be crushed by the system, but big enough to matter.

and here’s what happened in just one week.

in darbhanga, bihar, my hometown, i used my personal savings and persuaded ward councillors to cooperate. we cleaned filthy roadsides. the ward has already begun laying a proper road with materials in place. i hired poor locals on daily wages, and they were grateful for the income. people are now guarding the cleaned spots and they’ve stayed clean. local media covered it. my mom, my relatives, my friends—people i never thought would care—are now pitching in. donations have started.

all this in one single week.

the lesson? we, the people, are far more powerful than we think. we just haven’t realized it yet.

this is only the beginning. if you want to contribute—whether it’s in kind (jcbs, supplier connections, materials, contacts), money, or simply by sharing this post—do it. it matters.

i’m also setting up a small whatsapp group. not just to talk, but to act. i’ll be there every single day. if you want to join, let me know in the comments.

reddit,"street dogs causing trouble tldr below

there are few street dogs in my area (kudlu) causing trouble. these dogs are always barking and fighting amongst each other causing a lot of disturbance. there are several times i’ve observed these dogs chasing and barking at people passing by, often startling and scaring them. when i move around, they are usually friendly with me but i have seen them chasing people who may easily get frightened by stray dogs. 

they also constantly bark and fight throughout the night around 12-3am and this is making me go insane. i’ve started wearing earplugs to sleep but want to make sure these dogs are moved somewhere safe. 

i raised a complaint on the bbmp sahaya portal and spoke with a bbmp official today. that conversation went nowhere and he quickly dismissed it as an incorrect area and was annoyed that i wasn’t specific with my area. i mentioned my area and a few surrounding areas to help them identify but he still didn’t respond positively. 

i checked my complaint on the portal and it has assigned my complaint to a wrong location. i don’t remember having to input an address while complaining and it clearly shows my correct address on the website.

what can i do here? is it worth raising a complaint once again and try to get it assigned to the right ward or are there any other organisations i can contact instead?

tldr: i'm dealing with a pack of stray dogs in my neighborhood that are constantly barking, fighting, and chasing people. it's gotten so bad that i'm losing sleep and have to wear earplugs. i tried to report the issue to the bbmp sahaya portal, but my complaint was assigned to the wrong location, and a bbmp official was unhelpful when i called. now i'm wondering if i should file another complaint or if there are other organizations i can reach out to for help.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"a man in a lunghi outside my house, cairns, australia. there was an indian man wearing a lunghi tied up like a bengali/bihari’s outside my house in cairns, australia a couple days ago. it was 6am, and i was going to work. he looked work-old with leather skin but his eyes looked young. he was very thin. i think he was around forty years old. he had a sack next to him, and he was perched up on his crossed legs. he was wearing a button up shirt and i felt certain he had cash stashed in the roll of his lunghi on his right side. i asked him how he was in english, and he didn’t know english. i asked him in bangla and he said something back to me that i didn’t know and smiled. i don’t speak urdu or hindi, nor do i speak bengali well but i’m fairly sure it wasn’t any of those. he looked exactly like he was waiting for a truck or a bus or a train at howrah or old delhi. he looked like a bihari waiting on the streets of kolkata just south of howrah bridge near bbd bagh before the covid shut down waiting for the trucks to do a border run for bihar.  he looked like he was from a village that takes two trains and a bike to get to with houses perched on water and dogs and fighting children and something cooking somewhere.

i’ve been thinking about it ever since. i have no problem with him. i just don’t understand how he managed to get here, or who he was. all i can think of is perhaps he is someone’s parent, but he didn’t look like it. i asked someone from kerala, and they nodded and started complaining about refugees and how terrible they are and got quite angry about poor people having more than they deserve. but i just want to know the logistics. i don’t care about the politics.

does anyone know how someone i’m describing could get the visa, get the passport, get to australia and be waiting outside my suburban ordinary home at 6am on a weekday?",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"akasa air review: read this before booking your next flight so i booked a round trip akasa air flight around 2 months ago from bangalore to kochi.

one day prior, i had tried web check-in but their up portal said web check-in time not started yet.

i'm a very organized person so i reach the airport around 3 hours before and i entered the airport, placed by bags on the check-in counter and the lady smiles and says, sir your flight is cancelled. please go to akasa air counter over there.

so i go to their counter and the guy over there says your flight was cancelled due to operational reasons, we tried calling you but your line was busy.

in a state of shock i ask them wtf, did you send an email or sms? dude is confidently saying yes. i told him it's impossible, i check my email and sms and nothing.

i ask him what time did you send email show me. he's like that we can't share but we have sent.

i argue with him that there is no such communication and i ask him to put me on a next flight. he's saying there are no more flights, they will offer refund and i can leave the airport.

by this time another 4 people also show up with the same issue including an old couple, a young couple with an infant and one guy coming from canada.

to all of us, these people are saying same thing, there is nothing they can do and we should leave the airport.

at this point i start arguing with him and he's like show me me your phone i will show you the email and sms we sent.

i gave him my phone and he checks and finds so such information from airline. i was thinking in my mind, the audacity of this airline to cancel the flight then accusing me of lying.

so he says let's see what i can do and he just flees the scene. after 2 hours of waiting i start shouting on the other guy at the counter and he also says there is nothing he can do.

by this time, the couple with infant gave up and booked another flight at some 10k and left.

i argue that they have to compensate me or book another flight and the guy at counter says to wait.

i wait another hour and he says there's an indigo flight at 12 30 he'll try to book me on it.

i keep waiting and then after 30 mins says there is no ticket on that he'll try to get me on a flight at 2 20 p.m.

i keep waiting, till this time they don't even offer a glass of water and asks to keep waiting.

around 1 o clock, i'm at my wits end and starts shouting on them and goes around the airport looking for the guy who promised the alternate flight.

finally, i find him, scream at him and he gets a ticket for all 4 of us on indigo at 2 20 pm.

i'm generally a nonconfrontational guy but the sheer negligence and indifference of this guy got me extremely worked up. another thing i understood from this experience is that in india, nobody gives a tiny shit about other people's time, commitments or needs. only if you raise your voice there is some hope for any action from these messed up service providers.

finally boarded the flight and took off.

previously i had flown akasa, never had a problem and have even recommended the same to people-but never again. indigo has been late, but they have never cancelled a flight without telling me.

this post is for general awareness so that other people can avoid experiencing such a shit airline.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"worried about our smallest state: goa hi all,

hey everyone! so, i'm a goan kid, living in singapore for my studies right now, and i gotta get something off my chest.

i'm seriously stressing about what's happening back home in goa. you know how goans are right? super chill, kinda shy, not really ones to make a big fuss. which means a lot of stuff gets swept under the rug.

remember when parrikar was in charge? things were actually pretty tight. like, goa was clean, even with the whole mining thing stopped. tourism was still booming, everyone was making money, life was good! but ever since ""property sawant"" (dr. pramod sawant, our current cm) took over, it feels like everything's just gone downhill. corruption's running wild.

seriously, tourism's has taken a hit, so people are broke. and jobs? forget it, unless you're getting in through reservations. i'm planning to head back after i finish studying here, but i'm worried this whole corruption thing is just gonna get worse. we've got crappy electricity, the water supply's a mess (muddy water) or no water at all 4 times a week, except, of course, in panjim.

just needed to vent!!!",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"road rage and delivery personnel came across a road rage incident on r/bangalore. thought about posting that comment here for discussion. most of it is the same comment.

with the increase in delivery apps of all kinds, there has been a rise in riders who are generally poor people and mostly from rural backgrounds. now the issue comes that in order to reach on time (also the rush due to those 10min deliveries which are actually a problem) these drivers (who never had the civic sense of driving on roads in the first place) end up being extremely rash drivers. multiple times i have been hit by one of these guys, while riding my bike and most of the time they tend to escape/run away.

the issue increases when you confront them. due to their sheer numbers on the streets, it does not take time for them to accumulate support. (hell the chances are you scream at one and two of his fellows are right behind you).

now 99% of the times the actual law abiding civilian (not the rider) is at a disadvantage in these cases. the police will be taking their own sweet time to come and even if they do:

a) it might be late and you have been already hit by these buffoons.

b) they were not at the scene and will be taking a neutral stance.(understandable)

c) these idiots will gang up on you and be false witnesses that it was your fault in the first place. assuming the police force tries to side with you, they have their hands tied as per procedure they have to follow. chances are you will have no one willing to support you. (in the event someone has been able to find some random person's support quit your job and go test your luck. with so much luck on your side you can sure end up a millionaire.)

considering the above things an aggrieved person(like me) has only the fight or flight option. most of the people will be taking a flight option(me included have done it a few times) or fight (also done this as it was my sister riding behind me who got hurt and my principles are to protect her at any cost).

while at the moment i cannot do a lot about it but a few of the things i do is:

1. avoid these apps as much as possible. i prefer walking to the nearest store or planning my shopping to keep my transactions at the minimum.
2. in the event i do order which is mostly food, i do not add any kind of tip. to me the delivery guy is nothing but a part of the problem(most probably a problem himself) and i am not going to encourage his business.

any thoughts on this are welcome.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"india's bridge collapse scam: same contractors build bad roads and bridges, they fall down, and they get new jobs again - loot part 2 after researching bridge collapses, i dug deeper and found the actual scam that runs india's infrastructure sector. it's exactly like the akshay kumar movie khatta meetha - contractors give political donations (chanda), get tenders, build substandard work or deliberately keep roads bad, and get fresh tenders repeatedly. 

note: had to add some points from electoral bond scam here.

**the electoral bonds scam exposed contractor-political nexus**

when the supreme court struck down electoral bonds as unconstitutional and forced data release, it exposed perhaps the biggest quid pro quo scam in independent india. the data revealed a direct ""corporate-political nexus"" where contractors gave donations and got government contracts in return. 

senior congress leader jairam ramesh called electoral bonds ""pre-paid"", ""post-paid"" and ""post-raid"" bribes, through which the central government had given rs 3.8 lakh crore in projects and contracts to private companies in exchange for rs 2,004 crore in donations to bjp. in 49 cases, rs 62,000 crore in post-paid contracts/project approvals were given by the centre or bjp-led state governments, for which rs 580 crore in ""kickbacks"" in electoral bonds were given to the bjp within a three-month span.

**infrastructure companies were top electoral bond donors**

infrastructure and construction companies were among the top political donors through electoral bonds. source: [business-standard](https://www.business-standard.com/industry/news/infra-firms-among-top-electoral-bond-donors-124031501120_1.html)

megha engineering &amp; infrastructure ltd (meil) alone gave rs 670 crore to bjp over five years, making it the single largest donor to any party. much of this came after income tax raids on the company in october. the company defeated international bids and won the strategic zoji-la tunnel contract in ladakh near china border. union minister gadkari praised them in parliament saying ""megha's bid saved the government rs 5,000 crore."" 

but when political winds changed in telangana before 2023 elections, meil's donation pattern changed too. the company bought more bonds and donated nearly rs 100 crore to congress (the favorite according to opinion polls), making meil among congress's top donors. in december 2023, congress was elected to power in telangana.

real estate company dlf purchased electoral bonds worth rs 170 crore. pune-based b g shirke construction bought bonds worth rs 115 crore. ncc and navayuga engineering (both hyderabad-based infrastructure majors) bought bonds worth rs 60 crore and rs 55 crore respectively. welspun, into road construction, purchased rs 55 crore. kolkata-based sasmal infra bought rs 44 crore bonds. gurgaon-based apco infratech bought rs 30 crore.

**specific cases: give chanda, get contracts**

vedanta ltd purchased bonds worth rs 10 crore to be donated to congress in july 2023. by november 2023, vedanta was allowed to set up a mineral beneficiation plant in karnataka. the cost of the project is estimated to be around rs 225 crore. 

gvpr engineers ltd, a hyderabad-based company, faced protests from local farmers while setting up a private port in honnavar, coastal karnataka. subsequently, gvpr made political donations by purchasing bonds and donating rs 5 crore to bjp and congress. the company's subsidiary hppl secured the contract for this port project under the centre's sagarmala project worth rs 600 crore. survey work commenced in january 2024. 

bengaluru-based prestige developers bought rs 30 crore worth of electoral bonds through its subsidiaries in april 2023. the recipient was bjp. prestige group acquired 62.5 acres of land in indirapuram extension, ghaziabad, from the up government (where bjp is in power).

**the ""khatta meetha"" model - deliberately keeping roads bad**

remember the akshay kumar movie where contractors deliberately add less cement in concrete mixture to built a roads to get repeat contracts? that's happening in real life across india. 

in mumbai, six contractors named in bmc's road scam inquiry bagged rs 4,259 crore out of rs 4,600 crore total road contracts in just three years between november 2012 and may 2015. with less than a month's rainfall, more than 700 potholes were found on city roads. some of these roads were even in the defect liability period - the guarantee period where contractors are supposed to repair at their own cost. 

source: [hindustan times](https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/contractors-named-in-road-scam-pocketed-rs4-259-crore-in-3-years/story-nvm5kemcf7kfzop12okchj.html)

in navi mumbai, a road stretch from dmart to haware mall junction in nerul east was repaired with a new asphalt layer just two months earlier in may 2024. the work cost nearly rs 3 crore. within two months, numerous potholes appeared on this site. as per pwd notification of 2017, asphalt roads must have a life guarantee of 15 years, while concrete roads should last at least 25 years. rti activist anarjit chauhan said: ""this means that either the executive engineer is ignorant about the quality of the repaired road, or he or she is intentionally ignoring the poor quality of work done."" 

source: [times of india](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/navi-mumbai/activists-demand-action-against-contractor-after-potholes-appear-on-nerul-road-repaired-for-rs-3-crore/articleshow/111995498.cms)

**jharkhand road deliberately destroyed for fresh tender**

a viral video from dumka, jharkhand showed a perfectly good, recently built road being broken by jcb machines. the allegation is that the road was deliberately destroyed to get a fresh tender. 

a reddit post from august 2025 stated: ""in jharkhand, they've mastered a new scam — destroy a freshly built road, get a new tender, and pocket crores. the road that was just fine yesterday is now being torn apart. why? because there's more money in reconstruction than in maintenance."" 

source: [reddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/jharkhand/comments/1mm97lv/in_jharkhand_theyve_mastered_a_new_scam_destroy_a/)

**the defect liability period manipulation**

here's how sophisticated this scam is. every government contract has a defect liability period (dlp) - typically 5 years for asphalt roads and 15 years for concrete roads. during this period, if the road develops defects, the contractor must repair it at their own expense. but officials and contractors collude to let this period expire without repairs, so a fresh tender worth crores can be issued for ""reconstruction.""

in palwal, haryana, residents and social workers exposed this scam and faced fir for it. activist shantnu thakur alleged: ""the pwd department is responsible for maintaining roads for five years. instead of repairing the road, they allowed the period to lapse, so a new tender worth rs 2.5 crore could be issued for reconstruction. this appears to be a way to pocket money again instead of fulfilling maintenance obligations."" officials were delaying action even after multiple complaints from villagers since february 2022, claiming interlocking tiles and proper surfacing were not done according to contract, but still no corrective action was taken until activists visited their office. 

source: [the logical indian](https://thelogicalindian.com/palwal-residents-social-workers-face-fir-after-exposing-road-construction-scam-in-haryana/)

in pune, a rs 25 lakh road project on dnyandeep colony lane number 1 developed cracks and damage within days of construction. only after karvenagar citizens forum filed a complaint did pmc issue notice to the contractor. civic activist vivek velankar said: ""ideally, pmc should have monitored the road's condition and issued the notice proactively. it's surprising that the civic body had to slap the notice after we filed the complaint."" activist tanmay kanitkar said: ""generally residents neglect the defect liability period clause mentioned in the contract of civic projects."" 

source: [hindustantimes](https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/citizen-forum-forces-pmc-to-invoke-defect-liability-period-clause-on-damaged-road-101725128357830.html)

after the gambhira bridge collapse in gujarat that killed 22 people, the state government issued notices to over 25 contractors falling within the defect liability period who have been asked to repair 659 km of damaged roads across 17 municipal corporations. sources stated this is the first such massive campaign against contractors over road damages - meaning for years, the dlp was simply ignored. 

source: [indianexpress](https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/ahmedabad/contractors-served-notices-over-road-damages-under-defect-liability-period-told-to-repair-them-at-own-expense-10131286/)

**contractors show their power through boycott**

after bmc cracked down on contractors involved in the rs 352 crore road repair scam, the contractor lobby showed their real power. bmc was unable to find a contractor to undertake annual pothole-filling work during monsoon. bmc invited tenders three times but received very poor response. in the third round, only one contractor showed interest for the island city, while none responded for eastern and western suburbs. that contractor's bid was over 45% above estimates, so bmc couldn't appoint him. 

officials admitted that the contractor lobby was playing hardball by staying away from bidding for critical pothole-filling contracts to build pressure on the civic administration. with no response from contractors, bmc was forced to ask the pre-monsoon-work contractors to fill potholes during monsoon too, though officials weren't sure how sincerely they would carry out the job. 

source: [indianexpress](https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/after-road-repair-scam-crackdown-bmc-finds-no-contractors-to-fill-potholes-during-rains-2857662/)

this is the same contractor cartel that pocketed rs 4,259 crore in three years. when action was taken, they simply boycotted tenders, forcing bmc to give them work anyway. 

source: [hindustantimes](https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/contractors-named-in-road-scam-pocketed-rs4-259-crore-in-3-years/story-nvm5kemcf7kfzop12okchj.html)

despite firs being registered against six contractors and two chief engineers being suspended, bmc was still set to pay rs 324 crore to the same contractors mired in the road scam because work had to continue.

**the same contractors continue getting metro and big contracts**

the most shocking part? contractors tainted in road scams continue getting massive contracts for other projects.

a contractor tainted in mumbai's road repair scam was given rs 5,000 crore metro projects. 

source: [times of india](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/contractor-tainted-in-road-scam-given-rs-5000cr-metro-projects/articleshow/53659051.cms)

another firm under police lens in the road repair scam got a rs 360 crore metro line 7 contract. 

source: [times of india](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/firm-under-police-lens-in-road-repair-scam-gets-rs-360-crore-metro-vii-contract/articleshow/52243411.cms)

**the complete cycle - how it all works**

here's the complete business model (correct me if i am wrong):

step 1: infrastructure company gives political donation (chanda) through electoral bonds or other means to ruling party - anywhere from rs 5 crore to rs 670 crore

step 2: company gets cherry-picked for government contracts worth 10-100 times their donation within weeks or months. often ed/cbi/it raids are dropped after donations.

step 3: for every rs 100 contract, rs 15-25 goes to officials and politicians as commission to get payments released. this forces contractors to work with only 60-75% of budget.

step 4: contractors use substandard materials, skip proper engineering, and deliberately build poor quality infrastructure to maintain profit margins.

step 5: infrastructure collapses or develops defects within months. roads get potholes, bridges show cracks.

step 6: during defect liability period, contractor and officials collude to not repair defects. they wait for dlp to expire.

step 7: once dlp expires, fresh tender is issued for ""reconstruction"" or ""major repairs"" - worth crores again.

step 8: same contractor or contractor cartel wins the fresh tender (after fresh donations if needed).

step 9: if any investigation happens, contractors are suspended but later reinstated. firs are filed but cases don't conclude for years. companies change names to bypass blacklisting.

step 10: meanwhile, contractor lobby shows power by boycotting tenders if pressure increases. government is forced to give them work anyway.

step 11: repeat from step 3.

**the bihar tender scam**

enforcement directorate conducted fresh searches in a money laundering case linked to an alleged contractor-bureaucrats nexus in bihar government tender irregularities. 

source: [times of india](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/tender-scam-ed-conducts-fresh-searches-in-3-states/articleshow/121835946.cms)

the scale of bihar's contractor-bureaucrat nexus is evident from 12 bridges collapsing in just 20 days in 2024, all built by contractors with political connections. 

source: [indianexpress](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/indrayani-to-vadodara-3-major-bridges-that-collapsed-in-2025-10115854/)

**the bottom line**

this is not corruption - this is a full-blown business model. electoral bonds data proved what everyone knew - you give chanda, you get theka (contract), you build substandard work, it collapses or deteriorates, you get fresh theka. the contractor-politician-bureaucrat nexus ensures nobody gets punished, investigations go nowhere, and the same people keep getting richer while infrastructure keeps collapsing and killing people.

the supreme court struck down electoral bonds, but the business model continues through shell companies, cash donations, and other means. until there's genuine enforcement, independent monitoring, citizen activism, and breaking this nexus, indian taxpayers will keep paying for the same road to be built again and again while contractors and politicians split the loot.

**ending: a message to indian youth - it's time to wake up**

if you've read this far, you now know the truth. every pothole you dodge, every bridge collapse you read about, every exam paper leak that destroys dreams - it's not incompetence. it's not bad luck. it's not ""that's just how india is.""

you pay taxes honestly. they steal it systematically. you follow rules. they change them for profit. you prepare for exams. they sell the papers. you drive on bad roads. they bank the money meant to fix them. you die in bridge collapses. 

and then they tell you india is developing. 

you have more power than you think. mukesh chandrakar was one journalist who exposed a rs 120 crore scam before they killed him. but there are 70 crore youth in this country. they can't kill all of us. they can't silence all of us.

**the choice is yours**, you can scroll past this post, feel angry for 5 minutes, and go back to life. next year, another bridge will collapse. your tax will fund the rebuild. the same contractor will get the tender. more people will die. more students will commit suicide. more journalists will be murdered. and you'll feel angry for 5 minutes again.

or you can save this post. share it with sources intact. file one rti. join one citizens' group. support one independent journalist. vote with knowledge. speak up once when everyone is silent.

your grandfather's generation fought the british and won freedom. your father's generation stayed silent and lost it to corruption. your generation has smartphones, internet, rti, social media, and supreme court judgments on your side.

you're either going to be the generation that let india become a corporate-political loot machine, or the generation that said enough and fought back with facts, laws, and persistence. mukesh chandrakar died collecting evidence. students are committing suicide. people are dying in bridge collapses. your tax money is being stolen. 

what are you going to do about it? 

the choice has always been yours. silence is also a choice. and they're counting on you to stay silent.  don't....",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"anyone else noticing this strange rotten smell around evening &amp; at night? hi guys! 
i’ve been noticing a recurring foul smell, similar to the stench you get when a bbmp garbage truck passes by (kind of like rotting jackfruit) almost every night in parts of west and south bengaluru (nagarabhavi, ngef layout, banashankari). strangely, i caught the same smell near peenya the other day as well.

i’m puzzled, could this be from people burning garbage, a particular tree releasing a strong odour, or perhaps industrial emissions?

our air purifier at home goes absolutely berserk the moment the smell starts, showing red on the indicator. it’s worrying to think about what we might be breathing in and how it could affect our health.

what’s more concerning is that this happens regardless of the weather or time of year.

has anyone else noticed this? any ideas or theories? i’d genuinely like to figure out what’s causing it and, if possible, work towards stopping it.",PseudoTopic_0

i am just tired of driving my new vehicle in a different territory where i am not familiar with roads. cruising at good speed only to come across a sudden pothole and hitting it without being able to slow down appropriately. its so frustrating and least safe. what did we do to deserve such incompetent people at helm of things. bloody hell.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"why is no one talking about this? in amit shah's gandhinagar seat, 16 candidates have withdrawn from the election race. why would they do this if as they claim, their work has been so gooood? chandigarh to surat to indore and now this.

public doesn’t seem to care so neither do they :)

democracy and free and fair elections? anyone?

now some typical bjp bhakts will do whataboutery and say what about emergency, what about booth capturing in pre-2000 era etc etc 

amazing how people are willing to trade humanity, empathy and their freedoms/liberties/privacy, democracy, social harmony for infrastructure.

no whataboutism please, all these things (minus infra) were far better in were far better in upa era.

even if for a moment we give the benefit of doubt to those who support bjp and accept their argument or stance, **whats the guarantee that bjp would continue infrastructure push when they become authoritarian?**

and infra doesn’t mean only roads, airports, ports. it also means clean air, environment, accessible spaces, smart cities (remember?) , etc

and this infrastructure image that bjp has has its own fair share of corruption so bjp supporters cannot claim they are clean (all are equally dirty in corruption, none spared) , and has its own quality problems, toll prices problems, monopolisation problems. so the reason why bjp came to power in 2014 was riding the india against corruption movement.. now that differentiating factor of non corrupt vs corrupt has vanished.. whats left?  and something as recent as electoral bonds, washing machine to reinforce this point.

even if you assume both congress and bjp are equally corrupt and deliver equal economic performance, congress atleast has better social fabric and democratic values. see their manifesto if you haven’t. 

&gt;*i created a whole pdf document comparing both the manifestos topic wise in a side by side tabular manner so that it makes it easier and faster to make informed decisions for the benefit of all and it has the exact same words and lines from each manifestos and nothing is changed or deleted/missed.*

economy? most of the economic growth is because of the govt spending and we all see the joblessness and unemployment rates..if govt is really doing good then they should be talking about jobs and employment in the election rallies and propaganda…

but there are commendable positives like startups, digital economy

do you think if this govt had created enough jobs during its tenure, they wouldn’t have made a huge campaign and drumbeating about it? 

this govt celebrates even the smallest of things like the biggest of things …

what about religious hatred that is being spread and whats the point of all the wealth or infrastructure if you dont have social harmony in the country and have riots like scenario?

whats the point of all the development when you dont have basic freedoms to eat wear love marry according to your choice..

like many have pointed out, the trajectory this govt is on would end up being a banana republic like china with dystopian human rights and liberties minus the infrastructure that china enjoys. (*this is the best they can do at  their best, assuming no corruption, rapid industrialisation, infrastructure, which is unrealistic, so we would end up with worst human rights and mediocre infrastructure*) 

if democracy is intact and breathing incompetence and flaws of govt can be exposed and made accountable,
once you become authoritarian, what can anyone do even if you don’t do any infrastructure development? 

even if you ignore allllllll these things just answer this question: 

**if the modi govt is doing sooooo good (whatever this good means to you) then why do they need to demolish democracy?

wont they be re-elected anyways if they did such an amazing work that you some of you believe?   

rig elections in broad daylight, jail opponents, break parties, suppress freedom, suppress and control media, do all these nonsense religious hatred, pass bills without discussion debate, use money bills to bypass rajya sabha scrutiny, suspend opposition mps enmasse etc

reddit,"i want india to be clean but where tf do i put my trash? i've lived most of my life in oman. it is kept absolutely clean and tidy by the people and no doubt, the municipality employed cleaners who pick up the minimal trash from the roads, parks, etc. there's large dustbins every 50 -150 metres in residential areas that are emptied every morning by the tipper garbage trucks. parks and market areas have the smaller dustbins every so often as well. what i'm saying, is that you have no excuse to litter.

however whenever i visit my family in patna, it is absolutely filthy. empty residential lots resemble landfills. the sides of roads have mounds of garbage every so often. the metro construction has also messed up a lot of the busy roads from what i've seen. and again, nowhere to throw my trash if i'm outside. i will admit restaurants and vendors have small dustbins tucked away for their customers. but again, this should be the responsibility of the city right?

i've come to kota for coaching since the past year. much cleaner than patna, but still a bit lacking. i went for a run today and i saw 4 km of roads and just one of those large dustbins.

where is a normal person supposed to get rid of his trash when out and about? no wonder india is so dirty. the people aren't blameless and neither is the city management. thank you for reading my rant.",PseudoTopic_0

recently they removed/milled the existing road and relaid it completely.  the results? now the traffic has become half. like hardly 100-200 m before the flyover because now vehicles travel at 30-40 kph compared to earlier 10-20kph. better late than never right?

this just goes onto show how much a simple solution i.e. roads without potholes can do to traffic. again this doesn't solve all traffic problems but in multiple areas across the city.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"illegal (?) traffic barricades by homeowners my parents stay in an apartment, and i visit them every weekend. i usually park my car adjacent to the apartment's compound wall, like i've done for about 10 years now.

about a month ago, a homeowner (fancy-ass independent house) asked me not to park where i usually do, because it's opposite his place and he usually parks his second car there. i very politely told him that it's a public road, and that the only way i'm not allowed to park there is if it's right in front of his gate or there's a no parking sign (the road is always lined with cars to one side, always has been, never a problem.) there is no way this obstructs his gate.

the guy's now gone and put up a parking barricade of his own there, and he keeps it on the footpath when he parks there (props to his effort, must say!) but i'm pretty sure this is illegal - i just don't know what to do about it. is there a way to report this? (preferrably anonymously - going by his house and the number of cars he has, i'm sure he has some pull.)

reddit,"tell your kids, cousins and other youngsters: do not cross busy highways or roads with dividers. simply do not. i read with horror the story of a 14-year-old girl who died on the spot when a garbage tipper ran her over while she and her friends were crossing the road at the busy airport road at the hebbal bus stand in bengaluru yesterday.

one cannot describe the excruciating agony of a parent to experience the death of their child. a precious young life lost in a senseless accident is simply too hard to fathom.

we only know a few details of this case from media accounts, but most say that the girl was rundown while crossing the busy road by climbing over the divider. i have driven by this stretch of road a number of times and it is an extremely busy junction with traffic rushing to get on the flyover towards the airport and to the ring roads. motorists don’t expect pedestrians crossing this stretch because there are 2-3-foot-high medians dividing opposite lanes.

opposing views on underpass. as one can see in the photograph, there is an underpass just near the busy bus stop. the bbmp commissioner was quoted saying “in this particular incident, i don’t want to discuss who is at fault. police will decide that based on their investigation,” gupta added, pointing out that the subway is in a usable condition. i inspected it. it is not dark or in an unusable state. pedestrians are using it even now.”

another account says “the girls were crossing the road from the seeds corporation side to the hebbal police station around 12.50 pm. police personnel had flagged the bbmp officials about the waterlogged subway at 9 am and asked them to clear the water.” however, the bbmp personnel arrived at the spot only after the accident and cleared the water.

----

whatever the real reason, one fact remains – **do not cross busy highways or roads with dividers.** tell your kids, cousins and other youngsters. **a life is simply too precious to lose this way.**

reddit,"india's transport safety is a farce having big fines won't fix the problems. {bit long but don't skip} *i will tell you why i am writing this at the end of the post,*

&amp;#x200b;

# our transport safety guidelines are very backdated and so is the training given to drivers.

* the crash tests done are only frontal and apply to vehicles sold  from june 2019  passenger vehicles only no such tests for heavy vehicles, busses, smaller vehicles like commercial vans  autos, bikes                      which means a huge chunk of cars which run on our roads were never tested for safety including most vehicles sold before 2019 

i would commend global ncap for at least testing vehicles sold in india but even their testing is just for the frontal collisions only 

no tests are done for side collisions(the second biggest cause of death in a crash ), rear-end collisions or rollover crashes   

to put it simply a car can get good scores in global ncap testing but get very poor scores in euroncap *or like this global ncap is class 10 maths and euroncap is class 12 maths* 

also, the lack of safety equipment required in india is a big differentiator among the chances of surviving the crash or getting into one in the first place.

cars need one driver airbag only in india to be approved for sale, these were the requirements for the first-ever euroncap way back in 1997  &amp;  1979, nhtsa  (usa)

no crash-avoidance tech needed

no need to have automatic speed-sensitive braking which prevents head-on collision by braking the car itself at lower speeds 

blind-spot monitoring 

emergency alert for when the vehicle senses a crash an alert is sent to the emergency department 

shock absorbing  body frame (crump\[le zones ) 

usability of the vehicle after a crash is  also tested in euroncap which means is the vehicle unable after repairs or not and how much strength will the body have 

# lack of any periodic fitness tests 

it is a common sight to see people doing makeshift repairs to vehicles and running without working equipment in many parts of india 

nonworking brakes

 weakened chassis which may snap in case of stress

 running on really old worn out  tires, which can burst anytime 

handling issues like not able to turn or maneuver the vehicle due to broken steering 

sharp objects that can cause cuts to passengers or impale pedestrians, other vehicles like rods or bumper guards which are rigid 

a regular test is done by government authority about the safety of vehicles to prove its roadworthiness like the yearly mot done in the uk

this could be a good revenue-generating opportunity for the transport department these tests prevent vehicle failure while they are on roads and removing vehicles who are unfit for road use

as people are always being stingy with the upkeep of their vehicles usually commercial ones even more as they have to reduce cost busses are known to puncture a tire and skid on the road or brake fade 

# proper training for a license

 most tests in india are just driving in a closed path and parking the vehicle and that's it you get your license 

we are not taught how to:-

 change lanes 

overtake properly 

give way to an emergency vehicle like an ambulance 

use of high beams 

turning  on an unsigned crossing 

stopping in case of emergency 

instead of having those rudimentary tests that don't check for real-life situations simulators is an option most are not so expensive now and provide a very comparable experience for training

 even if having just informational videos in regional languages before getting the test could help 

eg:- while i was learning to drive a rickshaw driver was also learning to drive a truck he was illiterate and had a lot of difficulty explaining him the rules he didn't make it the first time after that he paid a bribe to pass the mcq test according to my driving instructor he said ""he wouldn't pass and every time he doesn't it costs him 500₹ so it's better he just gets the mcqs done ""

and i mean videos not just books or sheets department of parivahan can do it 

&amp;#x200b;

# infrastructure is subpar in many places 

if you leave out some special zones in cities most of our roads have these issues 

accident prone zone 

blind corners 

lack of parking forcing people to park on streets 

pothole-ridden roads we all know how they can cause bikers to fall and be hit fro ma a fast-moving vehicle from the behind 

our crash barriers are rigid which tear the vehicle instead of absorbing the force of the impact of the vehicle while other places have been using collapsible barriers lamp posts and signboard 

when some construction is done there are no safety barriers with lights just barriers and with illumination not present everywhere

busses and trucks dominate the roads they take 

overloading the vehicles 

carrying larger sized loads and not having load properly tied down 

usually, construction material carrying vehicles have their cargo dangerously packed which can impale people from the behind a rod could be sticking out of the vehicle in many cases another is bricks or stone carrying trucks never seem to tie them with a plastic sheet and in case of heavy braking a brick could easily  fall off the vehicle and smash the windshield of any vehicle that is close to the truck

&amp;#x200b;

# bikes &amp; scooters 

bikes and scooters make up a majority of the vehicles on our road and most accidents with these   easy to crash  2 wheelers result in fatalities 

bikes should have leg protection guard mandatory and abs without abs bikes are very easy to skid 

also, bikers tend to go into blind spots of bigger vehicles easily honking doesn't work every time 

people remove rearview mirrors on bikes for looks 

going into every small gap not giving any signals  before changing lanes 

tripling on a bike is common everyone has done it a few times in their life

# vlogging while driving 

these days everyone is a youtuber it seems people carry a camera while driving it is very distracting in my opinion and may increase response time  as one hand is busy holding  a camera and people are talking as well too many things to do while driving 

# use of dash cameras 

dash cams are very helpful in finding  who was the culprit and can be used as legal evidence as well 

but they are not mandatory 

# fatigue 

driving is a  tiring job and driving for long periods of time is not good  as we tend to get slowed reflexes  and poor decision making 

truckers are not required to stop after driving for 12hrs as they are in many countries 

# our culture of cars is  about show off 

people like to do stunts 

going  fast and record it most vloggers say don't repeat but the hypocrisy is they keep uploading content of the fast speed and stunts and they have to in order to make money

people race from one red stop to other thinking it is cool risking them and others lives 

showing off whose car has more bling bigger speakers no one considers even buying safer vehicles 

48% of all cars are sold by one country maruti whose safety record is quite low maruti and renault datsun make very unsafe  cars 

motorsport in can be done in  india 

 because of the hi-entry cost few people can do it in a safe manner instead of  having tracks where people can drive in a controlled environment  where they are less likely to injure themselves or someone else we don't have such things over here

there are a few tracks but people seldom use them or  even know about them

# reasons why 

it is not that india is a small vehicle market we are always in the top 5 for the past few years every other country of this size of the market has stricter laws even rusting warranty is provided 

india was a dumping ground for most brands to sell their products which were not allowed to be sold in developed countries  

tata and mahindra have been selling vehicles in australia with all the safety features that are needed 

the cost doesn't go extremely high but a bit more yes 

we are very easily satisfied people and quite gullible as well

what  the bjp government has done are baby steps while we need strides 

we should ask for better systems

if  we don't ask for the thing the government would never deliver  

if anyone knows a way through which i can maybe make my words heard to someone who has some authority or capability it would be much appreciated  

**a few days ago i was speaking to someone who travels in some countries he said he has driven vehicles in europe and some countries in asia when i asked him about india he said ""hell no"" stating that we take safety too low and we trust on gods for our safety** 

**this made me a bit angry so i started pointing at him how we have made strides of progress in the past few years and how he was wrong about the most accidents happening in india that  accidents per 100,000 residents is much lower in india when compared to neighboring countries, saying that only busses in winter get into an accident a few days after this a relative of mine was hit by a lorry it was night time and so due to lack of visibility he crossed the road and the truck just hit him he died there he was 2-3 years older than me i feel bad all the shit talk i did and it's not the first time a couple of seniors and friends had been injured in accidents a few scuffs may be a bruises a one senior who was racing on the road in his sx4 no airbags was someone who died a2-3yrs ago while racing on the streets but that didn't affect me as this accident did he was not racing nor doing stunts also now i feel bad for the people  who lost somone they knew due to someone elses faults i now feel afraid  driving as some bbc show put it the most dangerous thing you can do drive on a highway in india at night** 

 we all know someone who died in a crash or see clips or in the paper, but in fact, india and china account for almost half of the fatalities around the globe india exceeding a little bit the facts don't lie we have the second biggest population but to become a superpower we should have would class transport system

please upvote if you agree show that more people can we see this post and take away something or suggest me something i might not know about

reddit,"existential crisis and failed drop years, made my and my parents life horrible.  almost 20(f) wasted drop years of jee, and the existential crisis and nihilism. 

long story short, since childhood my life's meaning was to excell in academics getting 90 percent, making myself, my parents happy. and i did it till 12th boards. life was meaningful to me because i had a purpose, faith that my life has a meaning in grand sceme of universe. i mremeber, i was around 14, 9th grade when i started to question what is the point of life, if my parents and everyone including myself will die, it did not make any sense to me, i could not force myself to believe into something that i find it illogical, i avoided these thoughts making myself busy in study and talking to friends, 12th result was good,that year gave jee without any prep, got 95 percentile, thought to take a drop later, could not get tier 1 college, so i made another huge blunder of taking another drop. that existential dread came back, life was meaningless, jee and everything was meaningless, and i wanted to end my life, too coward to do it, so i kept reading some philosophical books on existential crisis nihilism rabithole, more than physics chemistry maths so i can find a meaning and sense why live this horrible life, came to a conclusion that, the only reason i find meaning in life is fulfilling my duty as a child, making my parents happy. my biggest motivation to not end is them, but even if i work hard, because of my 2 drop year, i wont get any good placement. 

i made them dissapointed even if they dont say it, i understand, it slowly kills me from inside , they are immensely supportive, dad(53) is an auto driver, drives 12 hours on a very bad road with potholes, he still never compromised on my education and my life. i wasted their support, money. i made their life worst too. 

how to make them happy, i dont want my dad to work like this. i dont know if i will get any good placement to support my family. i can work hard coding is my interest, but my 2 drop years will always be questioned, i cant tell my interviewer that i was depressed. very confused and hopeless. and i want to change things. but how?",PseudoTopic_0

multiple emails to the bbmp chief commissioner, zonal and joint commissioners and calls to the bbmp helpline, zonal control room and calls/texts to the medical officer, health officer and email to the cho have not helped with the chronic noise and nuisance from multiple automotive establishments in our immediate neighborhood. we have had to resort to calling the police numerous times for more than one commercial establishment. because this is a chronic issue and it doesn't truly come under the police authority, they are only able to talk to these people and the noise reduces for at most half a day, and then, things go back to the way they were. we are not sure if the pollution board can help because they apparently only consider constant and high decibel noise as problematic and refer back to the bbmp.

has anyone been able to get the bbmp to act effectively to get such issues resolved permanently (without losing unacceptable amounts of time, effort, quality of life and sanity)? 

we spent over 6 months in this year to get a neighboring commercial establishment vacated and it is not an experience we would wish on anyone. we already have intolerable noise for more than 3/4 of every day from residential sources (yes, they are unreasonable) and we have spent years negotiating with the problematic ones (there is but one). we also have been contending with traffic noise from nearly 5 am to 1 am, not that we are aware of twilight hours every time. 

it is these automotive establishments that have been mushrooming out of proportion in terms of number and noise and monopoly over the soundscape that we need help with. it is the bbmp that issues and is responsible for withdrawing trade licenses. we would be grateful for any advice or help.

  
thanks.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"the quality crisis in government-supplied rations: is anyone paying attention? has enyone else expericenced this ? i am a residence of north indian region here govt provide food essiential to people with lower income via their ration card or other card its a freebie (cost around 50-60 rupee for a family of 3)

govt is providing wheat , oil , sugar for about 50 rupee for a family of three but the problem is they are all of very bad quality in my area everyone believe that govt always provide good supplies but no my mom recently had some health related prob and after checkup dr asked us to change our food supplies like oil , sugar isnt this simply a case of very large scale corruption clearly govt provide enough money to distribute them at least of a certain level and there was a instance when there was a alcohol bottle (santra) found in wheat bag it was literally front of me i was surprised and more govt provoded suger is like how do i say that like its been soaked in water 

other problem 

i my area all the families have this card it doesnt matter wheather they are poor or millionares ( genrally most are landowners) so this a big flow how is this even allowed a person who drive a 15lakh car doest need freebie but they sure does collect this 

finally what is your take on this ??",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"how do i avoid food poisoning as a tourist? i am going to visit northern india in a month. the only problem is, that i am very paranoid about getting food poisoning. first, i wanna say, that i don’t want to insult anyone with this post. i don’t think that india is unhygenic, i just know that europeans are weak lol. i‘m already a vegetarian, so i will not be eating meat or fish. i also know about the cook it, peel it or forget it rule considering fruits &amp; vegetables. i also know about not drinking water &amp; ice. but i‘m still unsure about a few things. for example, are fruit juices &amp; lassis fine or are they risky too bc they could be made with water? is rice safe to eat? ik that rice can have very bad bacteria if left without cooling for 1-2 days, so i am curious, if rice is safe or if i should stick to naan. but then again, naan isn’t warmed up so that could also be a problem. are things made from dairy safe? lastly, i read somewhere that dishes washed in dirty water can be problematic too. how can i avoid that? i‘d be happy about some tips! thanks in advance :)",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"what are the fundamental problems of india we should focus to solve with tech? what are the fundamental problems of india we should focus to solve with tech?

for the sake of discussion can we ignore negatives and channel all our discussions on what we should solve for?

i worked in tech for 15 years and having gone through lots of job loss waves made me think why we solve our own problems than be beggars for job outside. having lived abroad for years also make me think migration is not the solution for problems. 

i am from punjab and there are few funamental challenges that i think tech can solve

\- farming and customers are still not connected directly, i see local farmers try to sell on own they are successful, but largely the connection is missing.

\- aimless degree selling business in higher education with no link to practical problems, how to build a culture where students become enterpreuners than job seekers

\- having got taste of sharemarket and trading, i think we can learn a lot from gujrat. everyone from that state participates in share market and generates wealth for themselves. we in punjab do not use tech to do that

\- use of rain water harvesting and ponds to recharge water problems of punjab. most of my state has almost no drinking water left or whatever is left is containing heavy metals.

\- is there any tech that can help with controlling floods? we got lot of damage recently, can concrete walls help in that case?",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"i (19m) saw mortality in mother's eyes. have you experienced it too with your parents? growing up you think your parents can do everything, as you get older you realize their real capabilities. i am 19m and i just saw mortality in my mother's eyes. my parents are older than other parents of my friends.
i never thougt about my parents death seriously, who does. but about a week ago, i came out of my room to see my mother crying with her eyes red as they get, my father panicking and hurrying up to get car keys while my sister in law calling doctors in our appartments. while i was just standing still not being able to even move as i saw my mother. she has some problems related to blood pressure but this time i swear, it was like i gonna see her last time. her eyes filled with water, i realized my parents are just as mortal as humans come. one doctor in our building rushed and gave treatmentand medicines and just told her to calm down. all situations are normal now. but to realize that my parents will leave my side one day and never come back is scary as it gets. has any of you experienced this too?",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"if i had a magic wand to completely reform india, the few changes i would bring: these are personally my views, in which if i had an opportunity to reform india, i would implement said changes. i would like to point out none of my policies align with a specific party but rather substantiate my points with data, experts analysis, and issues which are close to my heart. i would appreciate constructive criticism on any positions, give me a differing opinion or add on to the list:

1. make the acb (anti corruption board) a completely independent body out of the arms reach of the legislative and executive. it would be monitored by a body of supreme court judges where they have the complete liberty and freedom to conduct raids on politicians, ministers and judges. daily quotas on raiding houses of suspects and special acb courts to keep financial accountability of politicians. auditing of accounts at random, special house-checks at random which is streamed live and a mandatory publicised questionnaire on assets and liabilities to enhance accountability in video-format. including ruling party and non-ruling party members.
2. reinstate njac, to ensure nepotism does not occur at the sc/hc level. cji, lop and pm in the 3-member appointment committee. a secretariat established at the ministry of law and justice with minutes of meetings be publicly displayed.
3. productivity-based incentives for public employees, and removal of job securities. need to work hard to be paid equally well. this will ensure complete efficiency in all governmental sector jobs and public jobs. promotions on basis of targets and productivity solely. basically corporatising all govt  depts. to maximise efficency
4. every minister on a video-format on a daily basis should give a 10-15 minute briefing on every action which they took that day, why they took that, and what plans are they taking on issues which fall under their department. a  cabinet press-conference should be conducted on a weekly basis for a minimum of 2 hours where questions are asked to the minister on basis of the expertise of the issue, and questions taken on the pm.
5. specialisations in bureaucracy where transfers need to be capped at a minimum of  2-per year and inter-departmental transfers do not take place. a minimum time of each member in said position should be for 2.5 years to ensure that long-term institutional memory takes place and ias officers are specialists instead of generalists. lateral entry should be allowed in every dept/ ministry to fill up positions and separation of ias, ips, ifs and other class-a officers into different examinations. increasing the number of officers at the grass root level to ensure that 1 ias officer every 10,000 citizens.
6. introduction of non creamy layer in sc &amp; st's to ensure that educationally empowered and financially well-off families do not take away seats which are needed for socially, educationally and financially-backward houses. removal of reservations in government professions  especially at drdo, isro and other institutions of critical importance.
7. introducing an additional district court, every district, increasing judicial capacity and creating more vacancies in judiciary positions in order to alleviate the backlog of 45 million cases. introducing fast-track courts every district for discharging justice on severe offense (rape, murder, sexual harassment etc.,) and creation of ad-hoc courts for petty offenses over a minimum threshold level. this is to alleviate. i believe these measures will also not suffice in bringing the courts to par with the incoming cases.
8. severe investments into public transport at every metropolitan city by ensuring every metropolitan city has metro connectivity of a minimum 350 kilometers (similar to delhi) and a intra-city rail connectivity connecting less-dense and upcoming areas of the city. the minimum travel time once reduced to half present, investment into creating more road infrastructure should be presented.
9. complete decentralisation in which local municipal boards and gram panchayats get a minimum of 50% of the indian budget.  local boards focus on cleanliness, hygiene, sanitation, health and education at every city should be provided with targets, and target-measure mechanisms adopted and actions taken be publicised on a daily level to ensure appropriate public scrutiny occurs.
10. a cap on each mp/mla/alderman/gram panchayat to stand in elections for two terms, to ensure incumbency-fatigue  and monopolisation of power does not occur.
11. remove all non-essential  into subsidies (ranging from ladli behen/ gruha lakshmi, free electricity crap all the way to subdisdised electricity to farmers) every dollar removed from subsidies would be reinvested in r&amp;d and other infrastructure for technology and other science-field innovations. this will plug the cognitive drain and bolster india to be a tech-leader far after china and us. 
12. reducing the tax burden on the middle class, and the 1% of indians who pay tax, penetrating the taxation into the informal and unorganised sector via a series of measures (making it mandatory to except upi payments, keeping a good check of the hoards of black money) this will increase the amount of people under the tax system, increase govts revenues (many panipuri walas/ chaiwalas are earning a good 10lpa and not paying any tax.) this revenue could be better utilised for critical sectors which require funds. (aim is to get the top 10% of indians under taxation) 
13. recognise top talents in every field across the world, pay exorbiant amount of salaries to them bring them to india, find top talent indians and cater them to work together for an exchange of knowledge in fields india could pioneer and advance in. complete govt. funding and ownership of emerging technologies (priority in critical and defense tech.)
14. stop constructions of new govt. schools, redirect all funds into quality improvisation of existing govt. schools, bring all state-sponsored education under cbse board, who will appoint teachers on performance basis, incorporate atal thinking labs and a holistic quality education based on experiential learning in every rural school.  a minimum 10% budget directed to education (uphold the spirit of art 21a.) (aim is to blur the lines b/w a private and a govt. school)
15. remove ugc, enhance the purview of cbse to all educations, and a centralised education system in all universities where the courses, curriculum, experiments, internships are all detaily outlined by the board, every semester examination/oral examination should be standardised in every field in every university across the country. abolish deemed university concept, all engineering, medical, paramedical, arts degree should follow one high quality education with textbooks and sources of the govt. (the aim is to blur the lines b/w a private and a govt. college) (why should iit engineers have a superior quality of education and the remaining 98% engineers so under-qualified they don't deserve to be hired.) syllabus should be revised every year with an updation to global standards. 

  
these are only a few at the top of my mind, i can write an entire book on governmental reforms if needed.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"interiors disaster? neighbour’s nightmare with livspace, urban company, homelane, nobroker interiors you know that feeling when you dream of a perfectly designed home and end up running a mini-drama instead? that’s exactly what happened to a friend in my apartment. they hired a “managed” interior service, lured by promises of professional supervision, timely delivery, and zero headaches.  
the reality? a chaotic circus.  
labour teams kept showing up late or in completely different groups each day.  
cabinets and wardrobes arrived scratched, some panels didn’t fit at all, and paint looked like a toddler’s attempt at abstract art.  
electrical fittings were installed wrong, tiles chipped, and the promised precision was nowhere to be seen.  
the assigned project supervisor? a ghost. whenever urgent decisions were needed, it was radio silence.  
reporting damages? a nightmare. the platform blamed contractors, the contractors blamed schedules, and my friend ended up running around like a project manager, logistics coordinator, and customer service rep all at once.  
meanwhile, neighbours who had gone with nobroker interiors seemed to fare slightly better. their issues were acknowledged, followed up on, and in some cases actually fixed. not perfect, but at least someone took responsibility, unlike the rest who just passed the buck.  
this makes you wonder: are platforms like livspace, urban company, homelane, and nobroker interiors really “managed,” or are they just polished apps selling dreams while leaving customers to deal with reality?  
so i’m asking the community:  
have you experienced similar disasters with interiors services?  
which platforms actually took responsibility when things went wrong?  
or are trusted independent contractors still the only reliable option, even without formal guarantees?  
because at this point, “managed interiors” feels less like a service and more like a marketing story and someone’s got to tell the truth.",PseudoTopic_0

i'm sick of how poltician only care about their own agendas , be it any political party.
govt not taking accountability for things they were elected for in the first place.
air pollution, e20, aravali, electrical bonds and the list goes onn.

i'm sick of corruption at every level of governance you can imagine of.

i'm sick of capitalism how a small chunk controls the market.(growing mobile recharge prices and indigo fiasco being another).

i'm sick of this growing hatred , be it towards any religion, caste , community. (just came across people thrashing a guy for selling santa claus caps)

i'm sick of the fact that in a country like india all you need is money to get by and i promise you will get by doing worst of crimes.

i'm sick that we as a whole lack basic etiquettes and it's become so normal that we no longer question it.( u'll come across people throwing garbage anywhere.)

i'm so sick that my only plan is to leave this country. because this is bound to fail at some point. the system will collapse if a greater power doesn't come into play. the environment and living conditions will collapse if we move only towards a capitalist and exploitive society. and we will fail as youth if we don't innovate and create solutions. because chatgpt ain't gonna come solve this for ya.

reddit,"road fixed in whitefield hi everyone,

just wanted to share some positive news. i recently came across a video of prateek singh on youtube where he mentioned about the swatchhata app where we can report issue on that.

i was skeptical at first thinking that the issues reported that would go unresolved, much like every time this has happened.

yet i still downloaded the app and tried it out, reporting a bad stretch of road in whitefield (3rd a cross road near bagmane solarium city chinnapannahlli)

the road was horrible with two/three potholes that were so deep i was sure it was a major accident waiting to happen all it took was one misjudged overtake or bad luck to fall into the pothole.

and i too was frustrated with how the roads in bangalore were and was thinking things would never improve even though i have complained.

but i was shocked to notice a week later the job had been completed and that it was not a shabby job. manhole covers were placed in the right spots and were smooth and unobtrusive.

even though the status of the job was mentioned ""on the job"", the work had been completed and i was very happy to see action taken and the road fixed.

the point of this post was not to blow my own trumpet, but to urge people to use the app to make atleast the roads of banglore safe.

of course i also realized that it could have been pure coincidence that the work was already scheduled before and i just complained at the right time.

but i have raised another complaint about an open footpath that leads to a drain and will check if this work too happens according to plan.

doing this small part has lightened my mood, and although the app i a little buggy and raising the complaint might not work every time (due to some bug) i would say it is worth spending few minutes in raising an complaint.

also i am no way involved with the app or it's creation but just found this helpful to get our voices heard.

tl;dr:

swatchhata app works and potholes on road were fixed within a week.

edit 1: updated to provide the right name of the app

reddit,"deposit not yet return hi, all people i have a problem with my landlord not yet returning my deposit even after getting a new tenant..
so here’s the story i shift in a flat back in april 8th 2024 (gave some money as a token amount) but there was a problem with water, too hot in room even with fan on , food problem (i was eating from outside and haven’t bought much kitchen items)
so i told the landlord that let’s make a agreement but they were being delay after i sent all my details. days went by and on 27/28th april i told my landlord that i moving/ shifting, but back then i didn’t know the rules for moving from a flat ( tell the landlord 3 months prior ) but we sat down and make a deal that take the rent for the may 2024 and it was all set and told me that “the deposit amount isn’t ready yet but will be when i got a new tenant”. months went by until i call at the end of june and ask about it that the amount is ready but they have in cash and they’re out of state.again call them up on aug but still haven’t back yet..call once again on sept 8th and we talk on the phone told to come by next sunday 15th..went there, call them for like 8-9 times not picking up 
so i was went directly to the tenant (the room where i live earlier) i ask him when did he came here (room) and i was shocked to know that he was there already back from may/ june and yesterday (wednesday) i went to the landlord home but was locked from outside and even got a new tenant again and call them still haven’t pickup the call and to me it seems like they have another land/ house somewhere but i have no idea..i’m not from around here and i don’t wanna make a big scene by complaining to the police and all..so what should i do? 
i was thinking and the safest thing that came to my mind is to go directly to the 2 tenants and ask them to transfer the oct rent on my account..need some help here cause i’m out of all options and i do have the proof for the amount that i transferred via paytm just incase..",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"i raised a complaint with bbmp and it actually worked (within a day).  https://imgur.com/a/f6qudde

i live in malleshwaram. recently, we started experiencing a foul smell coming from the drainage. initially, we thought it might be due to a dead animal, but the smell kept getting worse day by day. so, i decided to raise a complaint yesterday evening.

here’s what i did:

1. i visited the bbmp website: https://site.bbmp.gov.in/mp3.html.


2. i clicked on the ""grievance"" button.


3. i sent ""hi"" to the whatsapp number listed there.


4. about an hour later, i received a call from someone who asked about the issue.


5. i explained the problem to him, and he provided me with my ward's helpline number.


6. i called the helpline and explained the issue.


early this morning, i saw the drainage management squad on my street. they opened the drainage and identified the problem: a blockage causing internal water stagnation. the entire repair operation took about an hour, and now the issue is resolved, and the smell is gone.

i wanted to share this process so that others facing similar problems in their areas can follow it. additionally, i found out later that there is an app, which is even easier to use.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"opening a free public clinic. need advice/direction a friend is looking to open a free clinic in ulsoor. his plan is to spend 1-1.5l per month from his pocket to rent a space, hire a doctor and a nurse, and provide free consultation and meds to those who may need it. the hope is to see it scale into a bigger, 24x7 clinic with more and more equipment added over time through own spends or donations. 

this is purely meant as public service, and he is looking to create a proper non-profit or charity. 

now as good as it sounds, us friends were discussing what may be required, and importantly if anything could go wrong - as none of us have any experience in this. 

all advice is welcome, but here are a few questions for all - 

1. can anyone open a clinic of this kind or does one need to be a doctor, or is there any particular licensing requirement? 

2. what sort of structure and entity is best suited to ensure donor privacy + accounting transparency 

3. how does one get medicines at preferential rates? 

4. are there any govt or non-govt schemes or initiatives that support such a thing? 

5. are any clearances required from authorities like bbmp, health department etc? 

6. how difficult would it be to find doctors and nurses on salary basis? by the way one part of the plan is also to block a few hours from known specialists for periodic visits 

7. how does one source medical equipment like ultrasound, x ray etc considering these aren’t sold off the shelf. 

8. are there any doctors who we could tie up with or get more direction and info from? 


any advice would be much appreciated. 🙏🏼",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"what could be done to fix the healthcare system of this country so everyone regardless of money or connections gets the care that they need?  plain and simple, what could be done to fix this. firstly, in delhi where i'm from, in upper middle class and rich circles there's a free floating opinion surrounding doctors and nurses in government hospitals being incompetent and they got these jobs through reservations, they're not the best educated to treat you etc. secondly, there is again in upper middle class and rich circles - this free floating opinion that doctors and nurses in government hospitals use all kinds of unsanitory practices like using the same syringe on multiple patients and there is filth everywhere and massive cleanliness related issues etc. now, this is something that i could really vouch for as i've seen this thing through my own eyes- i reside in west delhi and ddu hospital in hari nagar is the closest one to my residence. one night i suffered a severe panic attack that couldn't just be cured by taking deep breaths and drinking water. i literally felt my heart will explode out of my body because my heart beat was racing so high. finally, i decided to go to the emergency in ddu hospital and what i saw was a street dog moving from one emergency room to the other and on his paws were the stains of someone's blood (probably came from someone's accident) and nobody paid the slightest attention to it. watching this horror show, i just decided to go to the local pharmacy and bought an anti anxiety medication to calm myself. on top of that, there are extremely long queues, no proper cleaning and no proper sanitary practices like putting on medical gloves while treating someone -  there horrible things are something that i've witnessed with my own eyes. 

now, someone may say - well the hospital you went to had problems, it's not all government hospitals and to counter that argument, a couple of months back i went to donate blood for someone who at that time was admitted in aiims delhi. now, aiims delhi is often times regarded as not only the best government hospital but the best hospital in general in whole of india. now, to their credit, i didn't notice any unsanitory practices in aiims but what i saw were people all over the place sitting outside of waiting rooms, ers, icus on the floor. a hospital like aiims is the last place that anyone would prefer to sit on the floor. on top of that, typical government corruption by having links with doctors or admin staff would enable you to see the doctor in no time. this was the reality i witnessed. 

now, a single payer healthcare system like nhs or the one that canada has would be extremely benifical except all of its horrible waiting times. and frankly speaking, anyone with a decent amount of money would anyday prefer to get themselves treated in a private hospital. 

my question is - how to fix all of this. i know we have a massive shortage of doctors. our government should incentivise the profession of becoming a doctor or nurse to young girls and boys by providing competitive salaries and good work life balance. there is again a massive shortage of medical schools to address the massive deficiency of qualified doctors and nurses. not only this, the administrative staff is so understaffed in these hospitals resulting in long long queues just to get an appointment receipt. we have the world's biggest population of young people, all we need is the way to address our doctor and nurse shortage issue by making medical schools affordable for anyone who wants to become a doctor or nurse, cutting down on excessive bureaucracy and again making these professions lucrative even for doctors and nurses that are in govt hospitals across different parts of india. and here we are dealing with government corruption scandals and examination cheating in the neet exam in 2024. why would anyone want to become a doctor or a nurse in this country when the whole system is riddled with unimaginable levels of corruption and all the odds are stacked against you.

at the end of the day, i don't really blame the doctor for the things i've seen because a doctor could only do this much. it is physically and mentally impossible for a doctor to see more than 100 patients a day. what we need is an enormous amount of money injected in the healthcare sector to build government hospitals, nursing care units, medical schools etc. and establish sound guidelines and rules for different medical practices but also make sure to properly enforce them. 

i've also read on different subs that doctors have to literally pay in many cases to get a job at a government hospital. now, that is absolutely shameful and hard to imagine - a sector where india has a massive job deficiency, people are buying their way in govt hospitals to get jobs. so this corruption has to be eradicated. 

these are my thoughts on fixing the abysmal condition of our healthcare system where rich are thriving and going to private hospitals but middle class and poor are left to rot in long long queues with inexplicably high waiting times in government hospitals. maybe we can adopt a system similar to singapore as i've heard and read online that the system is pretty good when it comes to providing care for all citizens but also cuts down on waiting times - something which is a big drawback in single payer healthcare systems. 

anyways, please share your thoughts. i'm not sure if there are people on this sub that are actual doctors or nurses or any other kind of medical professional or industry insider or even a current medical student or neet aspirant thinking on becoming a doctor in the future - your opinions and thoughts on how to fix the healthcare system of this country (which unfortunately right now is in an abysmal condition) would be deeply appreciated..",PseudoTopic_0

i walk to my college &amp; i have to walk through narrow streets &amp; slums to get there &amp; now those streets are full of cows which like to stand in the middle of the roads. this causes a litany problems to commuters &amp; pedestrians alike where you got to navigate through narrow streets &amp; avoid hitting cows &amp; pedestrians while also being careful  not to run into gutters &amp; potholes.  


there's a railway underpass/bridge on the route i take &amp; guess what? two cows decided it was a good place to start mating. the detour takes me 30 minutes. so me &amp; other pedestrians had to bear with this unholy sight of holy cows deed &amp; not to mention the traffic jam it caused.  


also the other day a cow started running towards me i had to literally dive into an ice cream shop to save myself. imagine if there was some senior citizen or a little kid in my place?     


my friend was at his parents' bakery &amp; they had stored potato chips &amp; bikaneri bhujia in these huge plastic bags for delivery on the counter. one cow came &amp; started dragging the packets, spilled all the snacks &amp; started eating the plastic bag!!! my friends tried to stop it with a broom but the local auto rickshaw walas told him not to hit it as it's a 'god'. he had to make all 4 kilos of chips from scratch.  


some one needs to address this enough of this 'holy cow' bs. our streets reek of shit &amp; are dangerous. there needs to some act/law that needs to be passed in regards to stray cows  &amp; cows should be banned in cities.",PseudoTopic_0

also, can one directly go and drop their trash at the parking lots of the collection autos? if yes, does one know of parking lots close to hal 2nd stage? i don't want to be fined! does the road behind the esi hospital in indiranagar count as one such spots?

at some point we would just have to unite and do something about it or as many suggest find the responsible persons' home and make that a dumping ground. i'm just very frustrated, i mean no harm (of course).",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"cycling in this city is a nightmare i bought a cycle for fitness purposes and planned to cycle everyday for like 5 to 10kms. but due to the traffic,  dogs and steep roads i am already giving up just after few days.
i live in a pretty conjusted area with a lot of vehicle movement. cycling at anytime of the day is very difficult here.
at early mornings dogs are a very big problem. 9/10 dogs chase after a cycle, so cycling on cross roads is big no. if i go to the main roads, due to empty roads at the early mornings  all the vehicles will be speeding, and it scares the shit out of me when they pass just few metres next to me at 70+kmph. 

at evenings, the vehicle movement is so much that i will be honked, stared and cursed. two wheelers trying to overtake cars/bus from left side honk at me like anything when i am going on the left most side of road.  i don't know what do they expect when they honk at me, i can't even go to the side to give them space as i would be at the leftmost side.",PseudoTopic_0

she claimed that there were 14-hour-long power cuts in loni. even in gurugram, there were power cuts, she said, adding that the bjp-ruled states have been witnessing power cuts.

reddit,"honest rant about the new wash ""basins"" at the orion mall food court. you'd probably get me if you've used it recently my first question. why? just why? 
i'm sorry i don't have any pictures of the sink but honestly why would anyone do that. it's literally a flat slab of granite with taps over them and a tiny drainage cut out at the end. which architect thought, ""oh to hell with the usual bowl like sinks people have been using for ages. let's make it flat. they're gonna love it"". like why try solving a problem that never existed. 
  
the water just splashes all over if you don't have your hand directly under the spout as the water comes out with quite some pressure. and it's not the aerated tap either. it comes out like from a toilet jet spray and just splashes like crazy. and even me being 5' 7"" requires me to lean over and stretch to access the tap. and the distance between the water spout and the electronic sensor that turns on the water is so far away. usually you keep your hand near the spout and the sensor is triggered. but nope, some smart ass decided it's a good idea to keep the sensor a good 15cms away from the spout, for which i have to lean over even more. and since the granite slab is flat with barely a slight angle to it. all the tiny food particles from when you wash your hand stay on the slab and it makes the experience all the more disgusting.

rant over.
p.s:- feel free to add to my points if you goddamn hate it too. :/
 
p.p.s:- i might sound entitled saying this but just putting it out there coz it really really annoyed me.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"flipkart has scammed me and now i don't know what to do i ordered a zephyrus g16 from flipkart and i was anxious as fuck knowing what i am signup up for. didn't think i would get so unlucky. the delivery was done after a delay and i checked the product and it seemed ok. afterwards i tried to register my warranty on the laptop and it said that this device is already registered which raised a concern in my head immediately... so i checked the warranty information by serial number and it said that the laptop is going to expire next month of this year.. which is impossible.. then i find out this laptop is used and refurbished, the laptop was put into rma process by another customer who purchased it and it was approved for rma and then probably sold as a brand refurbished... however i was sold this unit as a retailing brand new unit at retail price of ₹2,36,990.  
please take a look at the post i made and help me share it.

i contacted flipkart about this, they tell me they're scheduling a technician visit which made no sense, so i contacted asus with the details of the issue and the visit they tell me they cannot give me a doa because it's not doa and they can't provide jobsheet of service since the laptop is functional. the issue is irrelevant to asus and that the problem stems from the seller giving me a used product. now i am stuck. flipkart won't help me and keep asking the same thing and asus cannot provide me document for something that's untrue.

i escalated to nch, and flipkart simply said the same thing and closed the case on nch. i reached out to nch and they told me to just go to edakhil and take legal action. i can't believe that this has been allowed to go as far as me having to file a court case. is this really it? can't do anything else? i am so done with this..

the seller was smartlaptop7 / the overclockers in mumbai lamington road. gst is registered under the name of sandeep bhansali.

here is a list of things that i've accumulated from researching about the laptop before coming to any conclusion.

1. unboxing video - learned that brand new units cannot turn on without power supply first given, the unit turned on with battery only.
2. polythene sheet missing on the inner boxes and on the charger in the video
3. registeration date of the laptop as per myasus app is september 02 2024
4. warranty on asus website with s/n shows to end on 30th of august 2025
5. i ran crystalmark on the laptop, found out that the laptop's ssd has active hours of operation of 217 hours which far exceeds me even having the laptop in my possession
6. official asus ucs database showing that the laptop was brought in for rma in september
7. cmd systeminfo indicates that the os was freshly installed on january 2025, the manufacturing is of july 2024.
8. i did research on the laptop seller from flipkart. they are called smartlaptop7 on flipkart but on invoice their name is the overclockers, which i googled and found out they also go by the name of laptop station and all of their reviews say that they were being pursued into buying refurbished, used or oem products without warranties at retail price. (not really proof, but that's the root of the issue that flipkart won't acknowledge, they literally allow fraudulent sellers to operate on their platform and also defend them)

please check out my x post and help me share it and get more attention on it

reddit,"varthur roads: every time it rains, i pray for my family's safety. last evening, a drizzle turned varthur main road into a treacherous river. the waterlogged potholes, capable of consuming a bus and causing it to topple over are a fatality waiting to happen.  
  
even on a good day, the 3 km stretch near varthur police station takes 40 minutes to navigate. 

yesterday, with rain and the chaos on outer ring road, traffic in varthur was unbearable.

my spouse returned home after a 2+ hours drive, exhausted and shaken. in stop-and-go traffic, she misjudged a seemingly shallow puddle that turned out to be a dangerously deep pothole, nearly causing her to lose balance and get crushed under the bus behind her..

she has taken the day off today, shaken and haunted by her near brush with death.

like many others we stay in bangalore due to job and educational commitments, i have raised multiple complaints which have either been ignored or have resulted in shoddy repairs...  
  
not sure how long we can take this indifference from the government.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"power cuts here are insanely bad in my area, is it because no companies or only low/mid-income group people live in this area? living in muneshwara nagar, hosapalaya here the power cut is crazy. previously i used to live in hsr main, but due to hiked rent prices i moved here 4 months ago. i’m facing serious power cut issues here.

this place falls in between hsr layout and kudlu gate, just near the iti layout area. most of the low-income and mid-income group people live here, and there are no workspaces or big companies around, only residential area and a few garment companies. mostly garment workers live near this area.

we are suffering a lot. previously when i was in hsr, power cuts were there but not this serious. i’m not exaggerating one of my roommates is a hybrid worker; only two days work from office, other three days work from home. he suffered a lot.

the problem is the network here is extremely bad. you can’t even make a call when you are inside the building, network is that bad. so we have to rely on wi-fi to work from home. he had to pack everything and go to a friend’s room to work. friend’s room in iti layout surprisingly powercut is not happening there.

at least 4 hours power cut is happening daily. from last week it’s even worse, yes i’m not even exaggerating. yesterday, 5 am power is gone, then it came around 8:30 am. then i went to office. when i returned home at 3:30 pm, power was already not there. it came around 8:30 pm. i don’t know how long it was out before 3:30, even if we don’t consider that, it’s crazy 8 hours.

before that day, they cut the power when i was working from home and i had to go to a friend’s home. we all friends are working, so we used to stock vegetables for 4-5 days in the fridge this is the habit from hsr times. but now all the resources are getting wasted rotten. dosa batter we use to make for 3 days, it goes waste in one day. this is our situation.

but in this area, so many women have to get their school-going children ready, do lunch for them, and then go to work.

the surprising and irritating thing is when current goes off in hsr or my friend’s room in iti layout, immediately, maximum within 30 minutes it will be fixed and current will come.

in this city, major things which the city lifestyle is built upon are messed roads, traffic, network (i can’t even use gpay to pay in shops or make calls inside buildings). for these things we can blame the crowd, but for this worst current, i am paying ₹1000+ every month. that is the most irritating thing.

i never tried complaining to bescom. let me know is it really working? will they take action? i want to know before trying.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"bangalore landlord mafia: ₹7325 water bill for 3 months?! on top of ₹2k service charge per month! hey everyone,

i wanted to share a frustrating and honestly shocking experience i’m having with my landlord here in bangalore.

my landlord just handed me a water bill of ₹7325 for 3 months. yes, over seven thousand rupees, just for water!

a few points for context:

we are three people living in a 2bhk.
we’re a small family with normal usage — showers, cooking, washing clothes. nothing excessive at all.
when i first moved in, the broker clearly said water was included in the ₹2000 monthly service charge.
on top of that, the building is a standalone apartment with absolutely zero facilities — no pool, no gym, nothing.
there is a borewell in the building, so it’s not even fully dependent on bwssb water.

when i questioned him, he just brushed it off saying ""everyone pays this much."" what’s worse: he refuses to provide an actual water bill. no transparency at all.

we feel completely stuck because he is holding ₹1.3 lakh security deposit, and we’re afraid he might just deduct or refuse to return it if we argue too much.

i genuinely feel this is part of a bigger problem in bangalore — landlords acting like a mafia, overcharging tenants without any justification, and using security deposits to threaten us into silence.

has anyone else faced such insane water charges or similar tactics?

can we legally demand an actual bwssb bill?
any advice on how to handle this without risking our deposit?",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"how to get crosswalk time for a crossing signal extended? hi all, 

i live next to a four way crossing and need to cross across two main road to get to the other which i have to do almost everyday to get to my office cab. 
the problem is that there is 
a. no zebra crossing demarcated 
b. there is a traffic signal that has that green/red man for walking /not walking, but that signal remains green for all of 4 seconds which is not enough time to cross before vehicles start and try to kill me

i want to request for the timing to be extended and the zebra crossing to be added but no idea how to go about it. 
i actually have past trauma with road accidents and thus get really anxious crossing roads. and this would be super helpful for me!

do let me know if any one has any idea of the procedure, or do i have to record and post it on social media or like hope that a canadian influencer sees this and makes a post because there seems to be no other way to improve things in this country hahah?!",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"28f, my experience at mahakumbh 28f, travelled to mahakumbh with my mom and brother. we did a road trip, took us 19hours to reach there, we keep getting stuck in traffic jam from kanpur till prayagraj. finally reached at the sangam ghat and the amount of filth we saw there was crazy. we decided to take a dip at triveni ghat, started walking again from sangam to triveni, all i could see around was people throwing garbage here and there on ghat. i kept my calm and ignored the people around doing all this 
finally reached triveni, me and my mom decided to take the dip first, i entered first to take dip and was about to start chanting some mantras, suddenly a woman next to me took a dip, and spit in the holy river she was praying in, i literally yelled at her but she was unbothered, took another dip and again spitted. i really wanted to punch her but i chose to come out and all i could see around was chips packets/polythene/food waste/clothes/slippers lying here and there 
people have literally pooped in the changing compartments. i was super disgusted with the experience i had to face there. i just wanted to get out of that place, i couldn’t focus on praying which was the whole purpose of the visit. 
and now i have no shame in saying we indians lack basic etiquettes, decency and hygiene.",PseudoTopic_0

are having these hoardings legal? if not, how do we get these hoardings removed? who do i contact? please help. 

update 1: found some of these newspaper [articles](https://www.google.com/amp/s/bangaloremirror.indiatimes.com/bangalore/civic/bbmp-fails-to-curb-illegal-flexes-netas-fans-defy-rules/amp_articleshow/123051722.cms) saying that these are indeed illegal.

reddit,"are you too superstitious about god? first thing first, i am not an atheist who don't believe in god and this post is not to disbelief any religios thing. 

context

why this came to my mind.

my gf is from brahmin family. so she takes literally everything from religious perspective. she eats pure veg (no onion garlic also). she always talks about if you do this this god will be angry, if you do this this god will be happy. and also about astrology a lot.

my take

as i said i am a non-vegetarian and not an atheist and i do believe in god. i believe whatever nature gave us everything is god. the air (vayu), fire (agni), water (ganga), sun, moon everything. we worship everything in hindu culture and i think all should be worshipped as these are essential for any living beings and we should be thankful to whatever we have.

problem 

now the thing is people get too superstitious about these things and they literally don't live their life at fullest as they bound themselves to do something which is religious to keep god happy. so that there will be more wealth (laksmi) comes to them. 

philosophy 

everything is for mental peace. many people get relief talking to god and do stuffs to keep god happy indirectly themselves happy. but people always forget to be happy we should focus on our life too. do hardwork, be kind, always help others if required and if you capable. by this we will become good from inside not just for showing but you will feel really good. 

what's your take?",PseudoTopic_0

inspite of all this, i have seen the people complaining about potholed roads, overflowing gutter, irregular electricity or water, fall at the feet of the same politician and greet the same incompetent government employee with a look of respect and inspiration and call them ""sir or madam"".

reddit,"internalized homeopathy &gt;this is just me sharing my own experience &amp; thoughts. if you have gone through something similar, feel free to share your experience in the comments down below.


i think one of the most.... jarring experiences in my life was when i told one of my best friends that i believed homeopathy is a scam, only for him to get really emotional and angry about it.

he later told me his mom was a homeopathic doctor.

it was at that moment i shut the hell up coz that wasn't a line i wanted to cross.

but i'd be a bad friend if i'd lie to him about how i honestly felt (coz he relies on me being honest to him as a friend), so i said ""let's agree to disagree"" and i never brought it up again.

him and his family has always been really kind to me. infact, i've practically been treated as family by them.

which is why this experience left me feeling confused.

worse still, it would not be the only time i had to stand down coz a friend of mine came from a family that practiced homeopathy.

i can see how indirectly calling someone's mother or father a ```delusional sociopath``` can be seen as offensive.... but what the hell should i say instead? 

and before you answer that, let me ask you something first. what was the last time you went to a homeopathic doctor and asked ""hey, what exactly are you putting in these pills? and why should i expect it to help me?"".

i bet most people don't even know homeopathy isn't desi, and was made up by some germen dude back when people still believed draining people's blood will cure diseases.

nor would most people know that homeopathy involves taking a toxic substance that have the same symptoms as your illness, diluting it in water or alcohol till non of the original substance remains (infact they believe the more the diluting, the stronger the medicin, as if their brain went out for a walk or something), and then selling suger balls soaked in alcohol for 500 to upto 3000 rupees while the patient is endlessly suffering and feeling awful for being a financial burden on their family.

worse still are the people who know all this and say ""but it fixed my xyz illness after i took homeopathic medicine"". 

i still take a shit even when i have a feaver and eventually the feaver goes away; so are you going to now also say that taking a shit cures the commen fucking god damn cold?

and it's not poor people who usually engage in such mental gymnastics. it's mostly rich and educated people who will have their whole world view broken if they have to accept that people who they trusted the most, saw as their friends or family, and who they felt would never betray them ... are running a scam.

and you know what's the worse part? it's not even like most homeopathic doctors know they are running a scam. they have the same problem but one level up with their parents taking them to homeopathic doctors and their friends and mentors being into homeopathy.

...... it's insidious..... and i'm not saying people should go to their friends or family who practice homeopathy and tell them they are awful people.... but it's doing real damage to real people in the real world, and the least you can do is atleast stand your ground about what you actually believe in instead of lying.... coz it's this cycle of lying to prevent hurt feelings that keeps homeopathy alive, and perhaps some hurt feelings over agreeing to disagree is worth it if it saves the life of someone out there.

coz otherwise you might end up learning the hard way,...that the path to hell is paved with nothing but good intentions.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"how much does a specialized english to armenian interpreter cost per day in india? hello everyone,

i’m looking to hire a **consecutive english ↔ armenian interpreter** for a 4-week job (5 full working days + 1 half-day per week). the interpreter should have a thorough command of **automotive, electrical, and electronics engineering terminology** (so, technical background or experience preferred).

i would like to ask: **what is a reasonable per-day (man-day) rate** for such a role (excluding lodging, boarding, and transit)?

some additional clarifications to help you give good estimates:

* by “per day” i mean a full working day (say \~6–8 hours of interpreting)
* the technical nature (engineering + automotive / electronics) makes the role more specialized
* the language pair is less common (english ↔ armenian)
* this is a continuous, multi-week contract

if possible, please share:

1. your estimate (in inr or usd)
2. whether that rate assumes in-city or includes local travel
3. whether your estimate is for someone with general interpreting skills, or someone with technical/engineering background

thanks in advance for your inputs!",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"the warmest room in the house i’m 24m, a law graduate from one of those tier-1 colleges that everyone talks about at family functions and linkedin posts. most of my batchmates went off to metro cities, picked up corporate jobs( sam, cam, trilegal blah blah) and settled into the high-rise life. i could’ve done the same. i had the offers. the interviews had gone well. but something inside me pulled me back home—to jaipur, to the old house where every wall holds a memory.

i chose a government job. simple. stable. close to home. people raised eyebrows. “why?” they asked. “you’ll waste your potential,” someone even said. but i never saw it that way. and lately, i’ve been more sure than ever that i made the right choice.

a few days ago, i fell sick. nothing dramatic—just a stubborn fever that wouldn’t go away. but it was the kind of illness that makes everything feel heavier—your limbs, your thoughts, even the light from the window.

i stayed in bed for days. i barely spoke. i didn’t have the energy to even pretend to work. but my parents… they turned those days into something soft, something warm. they didn’t ask for anything. they just showed up—in small, steady ways that meant everything.

my mother brought me warm khichdi and sat beside me, her fingers running through my hair like she used to when i was a child. she would talk about random things—the neighbours’ new paint job, how the coriander in her pots was finally growing, how i used to hate milk but now it was all i’d drink without arguing.

my father, who’s not usually very expressive, surprised me. he started making kadha himself—his own recipe, full of ginger and all the things he believed in. “this will burn the fever out,” he said one morning, placing the cup next to my bed like it was some sacred potion. he cracked terrible jokes just to make me smile, and somehow, that helped more than any tablet i took.

one night, when i was half-awake and sweating from the fever, i opened my eyes and saw both of them sitting quietly in my room. my mother was knitting. my father was scrolling through the phone, probably seeing the inshorts news (he’s gotten habituated to inshorts these days since i told him about it.) they weren’t saying anything, but their presence filled the room. when she noticed i was awake, ma touched my forehead gently and said, “thoda kam lag raha hai aaj.” my father looked up and gave a small nod, nothing dramatic, but enough to make me feel like i wasn’t fighting this alone.

and in that dimly lit room, with the fan humming overhead and the comfort of their silence, i felt a kind of peace i hadn’t felt in a long time.

as i started recovering, the house came back to life with me. ma insisted on feeding me with her hands sometimes, just like old days. papa brought home fresh flowers once, said he got them from the market, but i knew he had picked them from the little park near the post office. he thought i wouldn’t notice. i didn’t say anything.

we started spending evenings on the terrace again. wrapped in a shawl, sipping tea, i’d listen to them talk. ma would dream aloud about starting a herb garden. papa would complain about potholes and politics. i didn’t say much. i just listened. i felt stitched back into something that had always been there, waiting.

last night, at dinner, ma made my favourite sabzi without asking. papa acted like the news was more important, but i caught him watching my plate to see if i was eating properly. that quiet kind of love—that’s what fills this house. not loud, not dramatic. just there. constant.

i often think about those cities i could’ve gone to—the glass towers, the speed, the chaos, the money. but then i look around this house—the chipped paint, the sounds from the kitchen, the way ma hums old songs without noticing, the way papa switches off the lights exactly at 10:30—and i know i’m exactly where i’m supposed to be.

this house didn’t just help me recover from a fever. it reminded me of who i am, and who i’ll always be.

sometimes, the warmest room in the world is the one you never had to earn—just return to.",PseudoTopic_0

after coming to bengaluru in last november the hairfall started. and it's a lot. i thought i had some issues genetically (my father is 55 but still has lots of hair) but it seems all my friends who came here are having hair loss issues. i guess it's either the water change or maybe my pg uses low quality ingredients for food.

i m sure it's not stress, i m chilled af most of the time. 

anyone experiencing the same problem and how did you fix it? any doctors with some advice? if you're not one of them please upvote so this gets more visibility

also, i want to tell that the city is lit and i m not hating on the city. just getting a bit anxious about my hair loss.

edit/update- ro water seems like the answer. my pg owner will get angry but i'll wash my hair only and only with ro water. thanks for the advice guys!",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"office/commercial building near my house emits toxic black smoke at night — what can i do? i live near what seems to be an office or commercial building, and i’ve recently noticed something very concerning. they’ve installed a tall metal exhaust pipe, and every night around 12:30 am to 1 am, it starts releasing thick black smoke.

within minutes, our entire house fills with a strong petrol/diesel-like smell, and we have to run to shut all the windows. the odor is extremely chemical and burnt, and it’s becoming hard to sleep or even breathe properly during those hours. some nights it also causes headaches and discomfort.
i’m not exactly sure what the exhaust is for, but it seems to be connected to some kind of diesel generator, boiler, or industrial unit. the fact that it only runs at night makes it feel like they’re trying to avoid detection. the petrol/diesel fumes are triggering headaches and feel unsafe. i’m not sure if this kind of setup is even legal in a residential/mixed-use neighborhood.

i have certain questions, if anyone in here can help me with!
1. i don't know what is this exhaust pipe likely used for? generator, boiler?
2. is it legal for a commercial/office building to emit such smoke in a residential area?
3. which authority should i contact? pollution control board, bbmp, or another local body?
4. has anyone faced a similar issue? how did you handle it and what worked?

any help, guidance, or shared experiences would really mean a lot. thank you in advance!

reddit,"a third of women describe being sexually harassed on the road. how safe are auto-rickshaws? **the sky was** crashing down the morning of august 14th, as the 19-year-old girl approached an auto-rickshaw that she saw had been waiting for one more passenger to start off. it was the only one in sight. the backseat was crammed, but she had a test that day, and needed to catch the metro. she got up in the front seat beside the driver.

a few minutes into the ride, she felt the driver’s elbow press against her breasts. she shifted away, uneasy, and pulled her backpack up as a barrier. he pressed against it anyway. she realized he was doing it on purpose.

when she tried to resist, he grabbed her thigh and yanked her closer. she froze.

after a passenger got off, she moved into the back. eventually, the other seats emptied, and before long, it was only her and the driver. he refused to go further unless she agreed to a higher fare. this sort of bullying tactic is a shared experience amongst day-to-day commuters. you either pay, or you walk. it was raining harder now and the streets were blurred. in the next few hours, the rain would [disrupt traffic](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/heavy-rain-hits-delhi-ncr-ahead-of-independence-day-triggers-waterlogging-and-traffic-disruptions-in-several-areas/articleshow/123293561.cms) throughout the national capital region of india.

she agreed.

en route, the driver tried to strike up a conversation. he asked about her college. she answered, as vaguely as possible — “d.u.”

at her stop, she handed him a 200-rupee note. she hadn’t had any change. the driver kept it, and asked for 100 more — a total of 300 rupees. she didn’t know what to do at this point and blurted out that she knew what he had done to her, but she didn’t want to escalate, and asked him to return 100 rupees. he refused. she pleaded for at least 50 back. he returned her 40, saying he had no 10-rupee note.

later that morning, she posted about the incident on r/india, the country’s largest left-leaning subreddit, which had just marked the 79th independence day. many users asked whether she had taken a picture of his license plate. she hadn’t.

she fears retaliation if she tries to “call him out” — including acid attacks and rape — which is what several desperate men did to women, when they turned down their sexual advances. she recalled how the auto-operator kept staring at her face the whole ride. he knew where she lives, and might as well have figured out the route she takes to her college.

others in the thread said she should have screamed, or that they would have fought back — had it happened to them. one male survivor wrote that when it happened to him, his mind went blank.

i texted her later that day, with a few resources and the number of a social worker. but she never replied.

**had she answered**, among the key questions that i’d have asked: why didn’t she feel safe to go to the police, and file a complaint? why hadn’t she thought of calling the women’s helpline? and why not report it to her university?

surely, it couldn’t have been that difficult for the authorities to pull cctv footage and identify the perpetrator.

plus, at 19, most students in india live with their parents, who hold enormous sway over what their adult children can and cannot do. why didn’t she turn to them, instead of confiding in reddit?

analyzing a number of such experiences reveals the pattern: in indian societies, the first question people ask a victim of sexual harassment is — what were you wearing that made him act like that?

a 20-year-old woman — whom i’ll call s — recounted a similar story.

one night, she and her mother were riding home in an auto-rickshaw. halfway through a dark alley, the driver stopped, said there was a problem, and began to fix something under his seat. then he apologized, and asked s to hold something that felt like a rope. she did as he asked, and the next thing she sensed was an arm rubbing up on her thigh. she let go of the rope and told her mother to hold it instead. “don’t be stupid,” her mother beseeched.

she picked up the rope. and again, he groped her. he then tried to touch her chest. “i froze. he fucking smirked at me and asked to hold it properly,” she said. “when i told my mother, she yelled at me.”

she shoved him and stepped out. “my mother shouted at me to get in,” she said. “and he just kept smirking.” she told her mother she’d walk home herself and she could stay if she wanted.

at home, she told her mother what had happened, and why she was acting that way. but instead of consoling her, she got angry. “she warned me not to tell anyone — especially my father,” the young woman said. these things happen with women, her mother told her, and advised to wear a kurti next time.

“i was wearing jeans and a full-sleeved top,” she wrote. “it wasn’t my clothes and it wasn’t my fault.”

**in his 2020 study** on sexual harassment in chennai, michael l. valan [found that](https://doi.org/10.1177/2516606920927303) 35 per cent of 530 women quizzed had been victims of some form of sexual harassment in public transport, including groping. similar surveys by the world bank [estimated the number](https://doi.org/10.1177/2516606920927303) to be higher: in delhi, 88 per cent of women alleged sexual harassment in public transport. in chennai, pune and mumbai it was well over 50 per cent.

according to l. valan, 81 per cent of the victims were between the age group 18–22. 73 per cent of the young women said they were scared at the time of violation — the majority of which occurred in rush hours, on their way to work, college, or home. over half of them decided to walk away, and 12 per cent stared back at the offender — all of whom were strangers. only 6.5 per cent of them lodged a police complaint.

but these figures only cover buses, trains, and taxis. there are no firm statistics on how often women are sexually harassed in auto-rickshaws. the government of india collects no such data in any of these. law enforcement also doesn’t require to keep records of where the victim was harassed — only the various forms of harassment. the central motor act, in fact, with all its amendments, does not even mention auto-rickshaws.

section 75 of the bharatiya nyaya sanhita (bns), lists [specific acts](https://devgan.in/bns/section/75/) by men, such as, “physical contact and advances involving unwelcome and explicit sexual overtures,” as sexual harassment, punishable with up to three years of imprisonment — or with fine, or with both. but there is no separate law to deal with harassment on public transportation.

as of early september, the national commission for women had recorded 1,565 complaints of molestation or outraging a woman’s modesty; 1,447 cases of rape or attempted rape; 1,033 of sexual harassment; and 920 complaints of police apathy toward women.

the numbers are a conservative record of reality. studies show that only 1–6 percent of those harassed ever go to the police. dr. disari roy, assistant professor of women’s studies at diamond harbour women’s university, says a vast number of cases go unreported under pressure from patriarchal family values — because of the shame if families find out, and the fear of retaliation.

in the end, s chose to keep quiet for the same reasons. “had my father found out,” she said, “he’d never let me go out again.”

“this normalizes harassment as part of women’s everyday life,” dr. roy told me recently. “it keeps the cycle going.”

the nature of the crime also makes it difficult to document. did it happen? — yes. but when it’s a man leaning too close, angling his pelvis such that every bump of the ride presses him against her body, or stroking her arm while exchanging money and tickets — each gesture can be dismissed as accidental. when confronted, the harasser would feign obliviousness and deny their intent. other acts, like groping, leave less room for denial. this, of course, leads to a follow up question; a better one: if it didn’t happen, what are the chances that a woman would fabricate such an allegation in a culture that blames the victim and barely acknowledges sex?

the ambiguities are part of the reasons why women harassed in transit are less likely to file complaints than women harassed in other circumstances.

other surveys — beyond the sub-continent — listed the lack of system credibility as one of the main reasons why women do not seek legal help, which applies to this country too. several women told me they had not reported because they thought the police wouldn’t believe them.

in 2012, abhishek bhalla and g. vishnu of the tehelka, an investigative magazine, [posed as research scholars](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/in-and-around-delhi-cops-blame-rapes-on-women-tehelka-investigation-with-ndtv-475442) and spoke with more than 30 police officers from two dozen police stations across the national capital region. over half of them showed clear gender bias and insisted that sexual assault and rape aren't especially common in the region. “only 10 per cent are real, forced rapes,“ a sub-inspector of sector 40, gurgaon, told them. “10 per cent are genuine.” another officer dismissed media reports and asked them to stick to the facts. he estimated it to be 1–2 per cent.

rape victims were often viewed with skepticism. “if a girl asks for a birthday party, and she’s alone with two or three boys, and they’re drinking; she knows what’s likely to happen,” one officer said. “if she still choose to be there, she has no right to call it rape.” it’s the good-woman, bad-woman rhetoric: step out of stereo-typically appropriate behavior, and you are labeled bad.

another officer described allegations of rape as a lucrative business for women. “everyone knows,” he said. the claim that money is the biggest factor in rape cases, was also repeated by the only female investigating officer the reporters spoke with.

authorities further blamed the victims. “if girls don’t dress decently, men naturally feel attracted,” a sub-inspector of greater noida surmised. “it makes them just do it.” there were also frequent stereotypical remarks, and ethnic prejudices among officers.

tehelka summarized the conundrum: police believed women are raped because of their own behavior.

when families and formal systems so routinely cast doubt on women’s accounts, the disbelief seeps inward: many begin to downplay sexual harassment as a “social nuisance” that they have to put up with. “there is also a lot of inconvenience, time and energy required in reporting a crime and subsequent follow ups,” one study observed.

many stay quiet to avoid making a scene. “he was friendly with everyone else. i knew no one would believe me,” a friend told me about the creepy stares she got from an older man through her entire train ride.

others have no clear idea of where to report abuse — or how to access medical and legal support once they do. a 2022 study by the world bank [found that](https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/099630010202217290/pdf/idu08bcf65ff0ec9204d3f0bda6046ccc305aef5.pdf) 75 per cent of women railway commuters in mumbai were unaware of women helpline numbers. (india has 3 national hotlines, plus each state operates its own.)

**auto-rickshaws are** one of the most common ways to get around in indian cities. they are essential for last-mile travel as major transit stops are often more than a walk away from home or work. auto-operators, who are almost always men, queue their three-wheelers outside these stops, and frequently carry more than five passengers at a time.

how they operate varies from place to place, depending on the local laws. in kolkata, for instance, they operate within a fixed route permitted by the regional transport authorities, while in delhi, they operate on meter basis and have no fixed route. according to the latest [economic survey of delhi](https://delhiplanning.delhi.gov.in/sites/default/files/planning/economic_survey_of_delhi_2023-24_english.pdf) (2023–2024), the number of auto-rickshaws in the period were a little above 93 thousands — down from 1,98 thousands in 2015–2016. (a large number of other passenger vehicles operate within the city.)

mostly, people of the middle-income category, with an average monthly earning between ₹20,000 to ₹25,000, commute through auto-rickshaws. at times, private vehicle owners also prefer autos. the drivers earn less, around ₹10,000 to ₹15,000 a month; they work all seven days a week, for punishingly long hours, and rarely take leaves. but money is only one axis of difference. “public transportation systems operate as a zone of contact between diverse social groups in the city,” romit chowdhury wrote in [*city of men: masculinities and everyday morality on public transport*](https://share.google/wdvvastjwhqptck0x), which provides a detailed account of kolkata’s auto- and taxi-drivers — based on 18 months of interviews with them.

they are not gender neutral zones. these rides are shaped by, what he called, the “gendered politics of copresence,” where “masculinity operates as an invisible structuring principle.” in other words, men set the rules.

nearly all the drivers romit spoke to were aware of how women are harassed in public spaces, especially inside an auto-rickshaw. most of them said they step in as soon as they notice inappropriate touching; others admitted they wait until the woman speaks up. “if the woman does not object, it is not right for us to say anything,” one auto-driver told him. “but if the woman raises an objection then we chime in and say, ’please sit properly’.”

another driver said he always carries a stick, and acknowledged that, at times, it’s the drivers themselves who are the harassers. “there are some drivers too whose left arm is diseased,” one driver said. “i ask them too: brother, is your left elbow alright? i’m sure they don’t leave any women.”

“but precisely what about sexual harassment makes it seem wrong to them,” romit noted, “was because the woman is someone’s sister, daughter or wife, and therefore needs to be given due respect,” even as many of them insisted that woman also has the right to consent.

––

**one evening**, a 20-year-old woman in mumbai was walking home from work. she had only been in the city a few weeks, on a short internship. an auto-rickshaw pulled up, and she got in, like she always did.

a few meters down the road, a man — whom she assumed was the driver’s acquaintance — climbed in, and sat right next to her. he began asking strange questions, such as her name and where she worked — even though they had never met. she lied about her name. but when he asked if she worked at xyz company, she couldn’t keep up the lie, and said:

“yes.”

“what do you do?”

“internship,” she told him.

he prodded her waist, and asked to share her contact number. she was starting to feel uneasy. she tried calling her mother, but the call didn’t go through. he continued to act creepy, and after a few minutes they dropped her on the side of an interior road without charging money.

she dialed up her mom again, and told her she’s walking back home. on the way, she talked with her best friend about the encounter through voice notes — and later, posted it online.

a quick web search for “sexual harassment in auto-rickshaw” digs up dozens of cases. the first three i found are:

in 2018, a delhi student was molested by an auto-driver. she called the police many times, but no one showed up. shortly after, she posted about the incident on twitter. and the authorities took action. a case was filed against the auto-driver, and two policemen [were suspended](https://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ians/jamia-student-molested-by-auto-driver-policemen-suspended-118051101367_1.html) for their delayed response.

in 2020, an 18-year-old college student in mumbai posted a video of a driver masturbating while staring at her through the rear-view mirror. he refused to stop the vehicle despite her repeated protests. mumbai police reviewed the footage, and filed a case at the local police station. the man was later [arrested](https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/auto-driver-held-for-sexually-harassing-student-in-vehicle/article30967404.ece).

this march, in thakurpukur, kolkata, an auto-rickshaw driver [was arrested](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/auto-rickshaw-driver-arrested-for-allegedly-harassing-minor-in-kolkata-/articleshow/119435437.cms) following an extensive manhunt and analysis of cctv footage. he had attempted “serious sexual offenses” against a 15-year-old girl, as she was returning home from her evening classes.

the pattern is obvious: it’s always a young woman traveling alone — or the only female in the auto — as she is harassed, either by fellow passengers, or by the driver himself. sometimes she resists; sometimes she can’t. and the perpetrator continues until she manages to get off.

**the 2012 nationwide** protests over the gruesome, highly publicized [gang-rape and murder of jyoti singh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_delhi_gang_rape_and_murder) — a 22-year-old physiotherapy intern — became one of the most defining upheavals of modern indian life.

in the aftermath, both central and state governments announced a series of measures to safeguard women commuters. among them was a gender-sensitization program for public service vehicle drivers in delhi, including auto-rickshaw operators.

the program was run by the manas foundation, a mental health ngo, in partnership with delhi authorities. it was a two-hour course with interactive media and had open question-and-answer sessions. drivers who enrolled in it often admitted that their stereotypical thought-process was the reason women feel unsafe — and that it would have to change. by 2014, delhi required all drivers to complete the course to receive the fitness certificate.

then, on october 20, 2023, the transport department abruptly revoked the manas foundation’s authorization. officials [cited](https://theprint.in/india/delhi-govt-temporarily-withdraws-authorisation-of-organisation-conducting-gender-sensitisation-sessions-for-drivers/1816041/) delays in issuing certificates as the reason, and said it caused a bureaucratic hurdle throughout the process. per local news, there was supposed to be an online version of the course. but i could not find anything. (manas foundation did not respond to my requests for comment.)

since the past decade, a number of indian cities have rolled out pink auto-rickshaws to provide a women-only service. local governments in power often permitted drivers of either sex — albeit with better background checks.

and yet, the results were uneven. routes were often misaligned with actual demand. in allahabad, for instance, the designated routes bypassed schools, offices and commercial centers. the ridership dropped, and the vehicles ran half-empty. by 2019, according to union leader vinod chandra dubey, the scheme was unsustainable. the expansion of private two-wheelers among women further undercut demand. and so, the plan never gained traction, he [told the times of india](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/allahabad/but-pink-autos-fail-to-lure-customers/articleshow/72495769.cms).

the story is much the same elsewhere. pink auto-rickshaws have either been rolled back entirely or reduced to such few numbers that you might spend a month in these cities, and never see one.

**in her 2025 paper**, “[*challenges of pink (women) auto drivers*](https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.5287251),” neha prasad, a research scholar in the department of economics at ranchi university, observed that most pro-women schemes fail because of flawed design and inadequate implementation.

ranchi was the first city to introduce pink autos. but it was not a government initiative. in 2013, a local entrepreneur named sanjay sahu began training women from lower socio-economic backgrounds. he trained around 50 — free of charge — and helped them obtain commercial licenses.

of these women, 24 still drive pink autos; 14 had left after repeated harassment. sanjay had also recently stopped the training program because of declining health. no government office or ngo has stepped in to continue it.

neha found that nearly half of these auto-drivers were single mothers. the rest lived with their husbands. most had come from neighboring states. they lacked food security cards, and had only partial access to social welfare schemes.

and yet, all of them earned more than they had in previous jobs, and for the first time, had steady incomes.

among them, neha observed, the biggest challenge is in the form of harassment from male colleagues. auto-unions, run entirely by men, blocked women from regular stands and imposed an unlawful restriction that they could carry only female passengers. this slashed their ridership and earnings, since they had to turn away women travelling with men.

this is hardly unusual.

in 2017, ndtv [filmed](https://youtu.be/5-xydrgmo3c?si=08s7rocmaictoca2) a protest outside a police station in thane; auto-drivers had gathered after one of them was arrested for hurling sexual slurs at a woman driver. asked whether women should be driving auto-rickshaws, their collective reply was: “no they shouldn’t.”

“family and social taboos are often cited, even though there’s no evidence they affect women drivers,” neha told me recently. more pressing, she said, are structural and institutional barriers that remain largely unexplored.

for instance, instead of easy access to loans at cheaper rates, licenses, or route permits, women auto-drivers face extra scrutiny and arbitrary rules that their male counterparts do not. in ranchi, local officials have mostly looked the other way, partly because meddling in auto-union affairs carries political consequences.

but, neha added, that it would be misleading to assume that the government or administration is entirely apathetic; more often, genuine systemic obstacles stand in the way of effective intervention.

she urged the government to step in and fix these enforcement gaps, pointing out that more pink autos means more safety for women in public.

**news coverage** of sexual harassment cases largely focuses on whether the police have managed to arrest the perpetrator or not. little is said about what goes on inside the victim’s head — the intrusive thoughts, and the sleepless nights that come after.

how does she feel?

a 2024 [study](https://doi.org/10.26911/jepublichealth.2024.09.04.10) on the effects of harassment of women in chennai’s public transport suggested a score of 24 on the impact of event scale–revised as the threshold beyond which the risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorder and depression becomes significant. survivors averaged 33. in cases of physical harassment, such as groping, the mean rose to 58.

according to kaitlin a chivens-wilson, [writing in 2006](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18523613/) in the *mcgill journal of medicine*, survivors of all types of sexual violence go through, what experts call, the rape trauma syndrome (rts).

rts unfolds in three phases, starting with the acute phase; the survivor shakes, cries, and yells. but they can appear “outwardly calm and subdued” as well, chivens-wilson wrote.

next comes the pretense of normal life — the outward adjustment phase. with a high level of denial, the survivors distract themselves through ordinary routine.

in the final phase — long-term reorganization — the survivors confront the memory of assault and attempt to live with what happened. they “integrate the assault into their view of themselves and resolve their feelings about the assailant,” chivens-wilson explained.

**intense psychological trauma** such as sexual abuse fucks up how our body normally respond to stress. it increases levels of corticotropin releasing hormone (crh), which in turn stimulate the release of cortisol — the primary stress hormone, and also a major hormone of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis that regulates body functions and controls the neural, endocrine and immune system.

under normal conditions, a negative feedback loop inhibits cortisol by acting at the hypothalamic and pituitary levels. but trauma disrupts this regulatory mechanism, and reduces pituitary sensitivity to crh. an increased level of cortisol dysregulates neural systems causing inappropriate fear reactions and persistent mild depression among victims.

sexual harassment in young adults leaves deeper marks. they live with a mix of shame, guilt, anxiety, and anger.

that day, after s was harassed while she was returning home with her mother — she showered ten times. but she still felt like it wouldn’t go away. “i can feel his hands all over my body. i get nightmares about it,” she wrote. “i feel miserable. i feel so, so bad. i hate it, i hate her, i hate being a woman.”

she also didn’t receive support from her mother, which only made those feelings stronger, and more harmful.

“i can’t stop crying when i think about it,” she said at the end of her post. “i honestly don’t know what to do.”

according to chivens-wilson, many women who told about their assault to others often experienced secondary victimization. she added that seeking help from professionals without any prior training in sexual assault trauma can increase psychological and physical distress, too, as they have a tendency toward victim-blaming behaviors.

“in india, police aren’t trained to deal with trauma,” a spokeswoman from majlis law, a mumbai-based non-profit that provides legal aid to victims of sexual and domestic abuse, told me.

between 2017 and 2020, and again in 2024 and 2025, the national commission for women [conducted](https://www.ncw.gov.in/ncw-cells/new-initiative-cell/) 31 gender-sensitization workshops for police officers across the country. the commission has further trained 1,031 officers in partnership with the bureau of police research and development. but the efforts remain far from adequate. i couldn’t find any statistics to suggest whether any of it has changed how officers behave.

meanwhile, constables and head constables, who make up the bulk of india’s police force and are usually the first to meet victims, remain untrained in most cases.

even in 2000, when the national commission for women introduced the country’s first [gender-sensitization curriculum for police](https://cdn.ncw.gov.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/gender-sensitization-of-police-officers.pdf), it warned that training so many constables at the district level was impossible. training, it said, would need to be decentralized — taken down to sub-divisions and police stations.

for survivors, the situation is even bleaker. india has no national system of counseling or therapy. “one stop centers exist, but there is no real framework to provide counseling to survivors,” the spokeswoman from majlis law said.

in absence of formal support, survivors often turn to informal networks. online forums such as reddit and [safecity](https://webapp.safecity.in/) have become popular among indian women to share their experiences of sexual harassment.

safecity, created by the non-profit organization red dot foundation, collects reports of harassment in public spaces. each entry, that can be anonymous, is plotted over a google map. about 40,000 such dots have been plotted so far. the dots appear as clusters, and reveal patterns that can be valuable to “what people would rather not see,” safecity states in its description, “and a tool for those who must decide what to do about it.”

**the truth is** that women are just as likely to be sexually harassed in auto-rickshaws as on any other vehicle. some of the reasons often thought to make public transports such as buses safer — higher numbers of passengers, and the presence of other women — can just easily work against them. over-boarding, for instance, means more accidental contact, and more opportunities to harass.

in delhi, a 2016 study by manish madan and mahesh k. nalla [found that](https://doi.org/10.1177/1057567716639093) 79.2 per cent of female respondents had experienced sexual harassment at bus stops. in taxis or auto-rickshaws, the number was significantly lower: 38 per cent. and yet, the perceived likelihood of harassment was equal in either seetings — at above 85 per cent.

“a woman passenger is likely to have identifying information about the [taxi or auto] driver,” the authors explained, “creating fewer opportunities for victimization.” she’ll also likely be able to use her mobile phone and call someone, or share her location. a taxi or auto-driver, who depends on the profession for their livelihood, will likely see this as a high-risk situation, the authors said. the threat of being caught and potentially losing his income may lead him to make the “rational decision” not to harass a passenger.

but the result has a blind spot: it doesn’t adjust for exposure. it says nothing about risk per trip, or about how often women use each mode of transport.

put it this way: the data can’t tell you whether one auto ride is riskier than one bus ride. perhaps, autos look safer because fewer women use them. (a 2021 [survey](https://doi.org/10.1007/s41027-021-00313-1) showed that 3 times as many women in delhi preferred the metro to cabs and autos for late-evening travel. between 2016 and 2020, metro ridership doubled; and after delhi introduced free bus travel for women in 2019, the numbers swelled by a million a day. yet in one recent study, women [ranked](https://share.google/xlttw2hvombdbhxrn) autos nearly equal with buses and metro in terms of availability.)

an interesting finding in the 2016 study was that more women saw sexual remarks about their appearances as just as serious as physical acts like being poked with a penis or being patted on the buttocks. both are familiar risks in the tightly packed spaces of buses and metros.

auto-rickshaws, in contrast, present a different risk profile, because there is no way to measure risk in the same terms.

women have had to adapt to these unsafe conditions, dr. disari roy told me recently. beyond using mobile phones strategically, she described how women sit in certain ways in autos. one might choose the front seat if she feels uneasy with the passengers in the back. the driver, romit chowdhury observed in his book, would shift his posture away in response.

yet, as one woman put it, there’s the fear of “how he moves his hand,” which makes many avoid the seat beside the driver.

**a few days** after she was harassed, s posted a rant before logging off her account.

the post was made up of short, broken sentences, stacked one after another — almost like free verse. occasionally, she slipped hindi into her thoughts, trying to sound casual.

one part stopped me as i tried to process the words. she wrote: “everything is just messed up, and idk how to go about it…”

“can’t i end it? all.” she asked. ◼",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"warning. do not opt for airfiber connection from reliance jio  there are enough and more posts on reddit already talking about the atrocious customer experience with reliance jio airfiber. sharing my experience here as a warning for people to stay away from reliance jio as an internet connection provider.

i applied for a new internet connection two months back. yes, you read that right. i live in bengaluru (a globally recognised metro city) and i have been waiting for an internet connection for two months. while applying for the connection, reliance jio asked for a booking amount of rs 1000. 

this was followed by a two month period where i sent them 10-15 emails following up on the connection request to get the engineer to visit my place. 

their app and website looks flashy, but once you start using it, you realise that the relationship between the frontend and the backend is nonexistent. i got multiple text updates on different days informing me that the engineer will visit my residence that day. naturally, no such person materialised. i asked them repeatedly on mail to refund the booking amount if they couldn’t provide the connection. no replies.

finally, someone called and when i started shouting, they asked for ‘one last chance’ and promised to send an engineer soon. 

the engineer finally arrived yesterday. and the imitation-apple white branded boxes he was carrying from jio seemed promising. 

he started the verification process for which i had to submit my aadhar, photograph and more. the registration itself took half an hour. then the person informed me they had no monthly plans available and i must pay in advance for 6 or 12 months. 

more fool me, i was so relieved that i was finally getting the connection that i paid it on the spot - rs 4241. 

then, he started trying to provide the connection. he brought out the largest router i have ever seen in my life (half a vertical playstation or the full-size expanded oxford dictionary) with its own power supply box. the router looked old and used even though it was wrapped in paper. 

then once he managed to get the connection from the roof, this power box refused to power up. the engineer guy tried different wires, then tried to cut the wire and fit it in, but the router wasn’t getting enough power supply. 

finally, they said the box on the roof was faulty. but i already have another connection from act that’s working perfectly fine that uses the same. after about two hours or so, i lost patience. we had not eaten and these guys were blocking the whole drawing room. the job usually takes about 10-15 minutes as act/ airtel people have done it before. i asked them to leave and take the router and everything else as they couldn’t get it to work. 

this morning, i got a call from customer service asking me if the installation was done. i told them it wasn’t. apparently, the engineer had marked it as activated. 

and surprise, surprise! they informed me i had a working connection and was using it! i had to explain to the customer care executive that i didn’t even have the router or the fiber wire at my place for the connection that i was apparently using. i told them i didn’t want the connection anymore after all the hassle and to please refund my money.

then i was transferred to another guy from the ‘activation team’ that flat out refused to refund the money. he kept saying, “if there’s an issue, we’ll sort it out”, even though their own engineers couldn’t sort it out for over two hours yesterday. 

i promised to take them to consumer court and the guy seemed completely unfazed. i understood that this was basically a pyramid scheme adjacent - they force people to buy their connection for 6 months or 12 months with no guarantee of service. 

i’m now poorer by rs 5000 and have not received anything in return. i think i would almost feel better if someone had stolen my purse at knife point. it would have been better than voluntarily buying any reliance product or service to make one of the richest men in the world richer.

feel free to share this post with anyone in your circle so they don’t fall for reliance’s enormous marketing and lose their hard-earned money.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"an engineer's perspective on a dakla ceremony. what i saw and what i figured out **7 impossible claims, 7 perfect hits: how a dakla ceremony almost made me believe**

i'm an engineer from gujarat. i don't believe in superstition. i believe in data, logic, and evidence.

but on one night in october 2025, i saw things that made me question everything.

120 people. one temple. hours of daklas. three people shaking violently, claiming to be possessed by our family goddess. and then—seven specific claims about our family history. all of them true. every single one.

i was there. i saw it with my own eyes. and for a moment—just a moment—i believed.

here's what i saw. here's what i figured out. and here's why it matters.

# act 1: the setup

**the problem**

my extended family—250 people across five generations, spread across 15-20 houses in rural gujarat—was suffering. cancer diagnoses. debt. broken marriages. deaths that felt too soon, too sudden.

the kind of pain that makes you search for reasons. for patterns. for someone to blame. and the answer they arrived at? our family goddess (kuldevi) was angry. or an ancestor's spirit was taking revenge. or some malevolent force was haunting us.

the family elders made a decision: we'd organize a dakla ceremony at our family temple.

**the expert arrives**

a man was invited from a village 120 km away. his job? when dakla players perform and someone becomes possessed—by a goddess, an ancestor, or a troubled spirit—he communicates with them to seek answers. no information about our family was shared with him beforehand. this is important. remember that.

**the ceremony begins**

night fell. the daklas started.

*boom. boom. boom.*

the sound was hypnotic. relentless. the kind of rhythm that gets into your bones.

around 120 people sat in the temple courtyard, watching. waiting.

and then, it started.

# act 2: the evidence

**part a: the possession**

three people began to shake. violently. their bodies convulsing, heads rolling, eyes unfocused.

two of them were regulars at these ceremonies—men in their 30s and 40s who'd been ""possessed"" before.

but the third? a 16-year-old boy who'd never experienced this before the event. now he was shaking like electricity was running through him.

**part b: the number trick**

then came the first test.

a family member went into the inner temple, took blessings from the goddess, and wrote a number from 1 to 4 on his palm. nobody else saw it. not the expert. not the possessed. nobody.

he came back out.

one of the possessed men spoke:

**""two.""**

the family member opened his palm.

it was 2.

the crowd gasped. i felt my stomach drop.

**part c: the failures**

but then... things got weird.

they tried another test. this time, selecting a specific person from the crowd. the possessed tried. and failed.

they tried again with grains of wheat—3000 to 5000 grains spread out, and the possessed had to identify which one had been marked.

they tried. once. twice. three times.

eight to ten attempts total.

every single time: failure.

the expert's explanation? ""the goddess isn't happy yet. the connection isn't strong enough.""

the ceremony continued. the daklas kept beating. hours passed.

**part d: the finale**

early morning arrived. the sky was beginning to lighten. everyone was exhausted.

and then, suddenly, the expert himself got possessed. coherently.

and what he said... stopped everyone cold.

**""whose family had an ancestor named 'devraj'?""** (name changed)

a hand went up. yes. my great-grandfather.

**""are there three people in this family suffering from cancer?""**

murmurs. confirmations. yes. three people.

**""did someone die by jumping into a well?""**

silence. then a nod. yes. decades ago.

**""did someone die by hanging?""**

another nod. yes.

**""did an adult unmarried girl die?""**

someone's eyes filled with tears. yes. she died young. seizures.

**""in whose house is there a dead tree still standing?""**

multiple hands. yes. several houses.

**""has anyone filed a false court case against a family member?""**

uncomfortable shifting. yes. there was a property dispute. family rivalry. a false accusation.

seven claims. seven hits. perfect accuracy.

then, the final act: in front of everyone, the expert drank an entire bowl of sindoor—the red vermillion powder.

he didn't choke. didn't cough. just drank it.

everyone was convinced. the goddess had spoken.

i wanted to believe. i almost did.

# act 3: the crack

for days afterward, i couldn't stop thinking about it.

seven perfect hits. the number trick. the sindoor drinking. how?

and then it hit me.

**why didn't they repeat the grain test at the end?**

think about it:

* **the 1-4 number trick**: worked (25% chance—totally possible)
* **the people selection**: failed
* **the grain selection**: failed 8-10 times (\~0.02% chance—almost impossible)
* **the seven claims**: came only at the end, after hours of ceremony
* **the grain test again**: never attempted

if this was truly the goddess at her strongest moment—after successfully revealing seven family secrets—why not prove it definitively with the grain test?

**because they demonstrated what was statistically achievable and avoided what wasn't.**

that's when i knew. this wasn't supernatural. this was psychology.

# act 4: the dismantling

**part a: who were the ""possessed""?**

let's talk about who got possessed:

**person 1 &amp; 2:** regular attendees of such ceremonies. they've done this before. multiple times.

**person 3:** a 16-year-old boy attending for the first time.

here's what's crucial: **all three are members of our extended family.**

they grew up hearing family stories. **they're not faking.** they're in what psychologists call a **dissociative trance state**—a real, measurable altered state of consciousness.

**the science of possession states**

research on dissociative trance states (found in religious ceremonies worldwide—from pentecostal churches to shamanic rituals) shows:

1. **rhythmic drumming** at certain frequencies (4–7 hz, theta wave range) can induce altered states of consciousness
2. **prolonged sensory stimulation** combined with fatigue lowers psychological barriers
3. **social expectation** creates a psychological permission structure: ""it's not me talking, it's the goddess""
4. **suppressed knowledge surfaces**: information you know but don't consciously think about emerges
5. **it feels completely real** to the person experiencing it

the 16-year-old wasn't faking. his brain genuinely entered an altered state where suppressed family knowledge—stories heard from elders, conversations overheard—came pouring out.

think of it like this: hypnosis is real. sleepwalking is real. trance states are real. the brain is capable of incredible things. none of it requires supernatural explanation.

**part b: the statistical takedown**

now, let's look at those seven ""miraculous"" claims. i'm going to apply actual statistics to my family numbers:

**reminder:** 250 total people (across 5 generations from \~1875–2025), 170 currently alive, 80 deceased, 15–20 houses.

**claim 1: ""whose family had ancestor named devraj?""**

devraj is a name derived from a god, **historically common** among gujaratis.  
expected for our family: **1–5 people** with variants of this name.  
asking this in rural gujarat is like asking, “did anyone in your english family have a john?”

**claim 2: ""three people with cancer?""**

1 in 9 indians will develop cancer.  
170 living people ÷ 9 = \~19 expected.  
3 active cases = below average. not miraculous.

**claim 3 &amp; 4: ""death by well"" and ""death by hanging""**

suicides: 8–12% of deaths in rural india.  
of those: 64% by hanging, \~9% by drowning/well.  
for our 80 deceased: 6–10 suicides expected.  
so 4–6 hangings and 1 drowning = statistically expected.

**claim 5: ""unmarried girl who died""**

epilepsy prevalence \~5–6 per 1,000.  
250 people = 1–3 expected cases across generations.  
young unmarried woman dying from seizures is tragic—but not rare.

**claim 6: ""dead tree standing""**

15–20 rural homes → almost guaranteed that some have dead trees.  
tree mortality and cultural reasons make this **100% probable**.

**claim 7: ""false court case filed""**

66% of indian civil cases are land/property disputes.  
15–20 houses → multiple inheritance lines.  
a false case in an extended indian family? **virtually guaranteed.**

**part c: the ceremony architecture**

**the setup:**

1. hours of drumming (theta wave induction)
2. late night → fatigue
3. 120 witnesses → social pressure
4. atmosphere → sensory overload
5. failures excused (“goddess not ready yet”)
6. successes timed for peak suggestibility

**the questioning strategy:**  
he didn’t state facts—he asked *questions*.  
""whose family had ancestor devraj?""  
this prompts the crowd to volunteer info—classic **cold reading**.

**the barnum effect:**  
the statements *feel* specific but are statistically common:

* common name
* common disease
* common deaths
* common disputes
* common phenomena

**part d: the sindoor drinking**

""but he drank sindoor! that's impossible!""  
is it though?

fire-walkers, sword-swallowers, and glass-eaters exist.  
sindoor consumption could involve:

1. gradual tolerance building
2. quick swallowing
3. traditional know-how

painful? yes. supernatural? no.

# act 5: the bigger picture

**why this persists**

our brains are wired for **pattern recognition** and **social proof**.  
when 120 people believe something, your brain follows.

we remember the seven hits. we forget the 8–10 failures.

**the real cost**

it’s not money—it’s **critical thinking**.  
supernatural explanations delay real ones:

* epilepsy becomes “a curse”
* mental illness becomes “possession”
* medicine and therapy are delayed

**why i'm writing this**

not to mock anyone.  
not to call the expert a fraud.  
but to show: **everything supernatural that night had a natural explanation.**

critical thinking isn’t cynicism. it’s curiosity.

# closing: the reflection

that night, i almost believed in ghosts. in spirits. in divine possession.

now i understand something more fascinating: **the human mind.**

the daklas weren’t calling spirits—they were calling something within us.

those three possessed people weren’t frauds.  
they experienced real altered states.

the seven claims weren’t miracles.  
they were statistically inevitable.

the expert wasn’t necessarily a con artist.  
he was part of an ancient system that accidentally discovered psychology.

**and that’s more fascinating than any supernatural explanation could ever be.**

because it means *we* have the power.  
not the goddess. not the ancestors. not the spirits.

us.  
our brains. our pattern recognition. our capacity for trance states. our statistical likelihood of tragedy.

next time you see something ""unexplainable,"" ask:  
**""what’s the base rate? what am i not seeing?""**

you might be surprised.

**p.s.**  
you’re right—i can’t *prove* it wasn’t the goddess.  
but every single thing that happened can be explained naturally.  
and when natural explanations exist, **occam’s razor** applies.

the goddess didn’t speak that night.

but 250 years of family history, human psychology, and probability did.

and that’s okay.

*written by an engineer who almost believed, and who’s grateful he stopped to think.*

reddit,"help needed : a strap puppy was hit by a bike. so, last night, when i was out on a night stroll, a bike hit a puppy.

blood came out of her mouth (maybe around 50-100 ml), and she was wriggling in pain. it looked like she will not make it.

but i checked on her this morning, and she is alive. doesn't seem to find any external injuries except mouth. she is trying to walk, but is not able, but other than that, she is looking okay.

i'd tried to feed her. had given her water. but the problem is i live in a small town, and hence no vet.

what should i do now?

edit: it's ""stray""

edit 2: she has gained some strength now. still not eating food, but is able to lift herself up and walk. her condition has improved a lot. trying to give her milk.

will go to the doc soon. have inquired about it and there's a government livestock doc in my town. thanks for the help.",PseudoTopic_159

reddit,"alternative political party in india **came across a post earlier today discussing alternative political parties in india. i couldn’t track it down later, but it sparked some thoughts i wanted to share.**

a  big, uncomfortable point was raised in that post: “can a party of educated, ‘honest’ people fix india and deal with its issues?

the problem isn’t just “bad leaders” or “corrupt politicians” – it’s that a large part of society wants the same shortcuts, kickbacks, and conveniences that those leaders represent.

**so the real question is, “can a party of educated, ‘honest’ people really fix a fundamentally undisciplined society?”**

we like to blame politicians, “the system”, or “uneducated masses” for everything wrong with our country. but honestly, the rot is not just at the top. it runs straight through regular, educated, middle-class people like us. i’m increasingly convinced that our core problem isn’t lack of intelligence, education, or money. it’s a lack of discipline, respect for rules, and any real concept of a shared society.

look at the most basic stuff (highlighting everyday indiscipline):

* people jumping red lights and ignoring traffic rules.
* throwing garbage wherever is convenient, with zero sense of shared neighbourhood.
* pushing into queues, blocking doors in trains/buses/lifts, and stopping in the middle of the road to get off.
* blaring loud music in the name of personal celebration or religious events/blocking roads and disrupting traffic for religious congregations or processions. public inconvenience is often brushed off as “faith” or “tradition,” with little accountability.
* “gaming” customers/clients at every possible opportunity.
* small-time shops and service providers hiding income or avoiding taxes while complaining about government inefficiency
* no dignity of labour – looking down on people who do essential but “low-status” work.

these are not complex policy failures. these are character failures. and they cut across class, language, and education.

**when the “educated” are the problem: two personal examples:**

* i’ve been part of multiple college bodies/committees. for many peers, the primary motive was simple: get close to the system and make money. no sense of “the system is corrupt; we should try to fix it.” instead, it was: “the system is corrupt; i want my share.”
* ·medical system corruption: in medical practice, the rot is even deeper. everything can involve a cut – college seat recognition, recruitment, machine purchases, and medicine procurement. one concrete example: in a tertiary care centre, a basic injection like triamcinolone acetonide from a reputed brand (abbott, around ₹80) was not available. instead, the hospital store pushed a “generic” version priced around ₹120, sold with a 20% discount to make it look cheap. the product was so poor in quality that it wouldn’t even dissolve properly in the syringe. that’s how i started examining the brand.

the question is obvious: who heads the pharmacy committee? who approved this? who pockets the kickback? these are not “evil outsiders”. these are doctors, administrators – people from similar social and educational backgrounds as us. and almost no one objects, because everyone either benefits or hopes to benefit from the same system.

“people like us” are the system in both education and healthcare. i’ve seen the same pattern: the corruption is not imposed from above; it is co-created by ordinary, well-read, “respectable” people. almost nobody wants to take real action because they want to be part of the network when it benefits them.  they don’t want to be the odd one out and risk their own career.

**so we end up with this hypocrisy: we want to personally enjoy the advantages of a broken system and then complain that our leaders are corrupt. why would we magically elect saints when most of us don’t behave like saints in our own little spheres of power?**

do we actually want discipline?

we keep saying, “we need educated, honest people in politics.” but i don’t think education or money is the real differentiator. what we actually need are people who:

* respect the constitution and rule of law.
* value the dignity of labour.
* understand shared public spaces and common resources.
* are willing to sacrifice short-term personal gain for long-term public good.

and that kind of person is incredibly rare. even when such individuals or parties appear, the average voter is often swayed by :

* grandeur and personality cults.
* unaccountable power and display of wealth.
* caste/religion identity.
* the fantasy of “if my person is in power, i’ll also benefit.”

**in other words, voters end up choosing a “true representative” – someone who acts exactly like they would if they had that power.**

another uncomfortable observation (personal opinion, not looking to debate theology): in very religious societies, people often “do good” out of fear of god or punishment in the afterlife, not because it’s intrinsically right. religion also offers convenient mechanisms of repentance: commit wrongdoing, then offset it via ritual, donation, or some symbolic act. this can unintentionally enable indiscipline and unethical behaviour, because you always have a moral “reset button”.

i’m not saying all religious people are unethical. i’m saying overtly religious cultures can sometimes externalise morality (“god is watching”) instead of internalising it (“i must do the right thing even if nobody is watching”).

so, can “honest, educated” parties change anything? parties like aap or people like prashant kishor initially gave hope that a cleaner, more technocratic, educated leadership might reset the system. but what did we see?

* they faced massive resistance from existing interests.
* the public, including people like us, eventually tore them down, mocked them, or moved on.
* the system pushed back – and society wasn’t disciplined or principled enough to hold the line and defend them.

if the broad social culture doesn’t change, any “honest” party that comes to power will have two options:

* adapt to the existing dirty system to survive.
* fight it and get crushed or sidelined.

**without a critical mass of citizens who actually practice discipline and integrity in daily life, i suspect any such party can at best bring fleeting, cosmetic change.**

 

tl;dr :

**if large parts of society themselves are corrupt, undisciplined, and opportunistic, can a party of educated, “honest” individuals truly change the system in a lasting way? or will the system inevitably change them instead?**

reddit,"a homeowner who makes 14 months of rental income every year. i'm currently renting in a multi-floor independent building owned by an advocate/lawyer who rents out eight units. the rental agreement is pretty awful, but i won't dive into the details right now.

he markets the homes at around ₹5,000 less than similar ones in the area, using a lot of sweet talk to attract tenants. however, once you move in, things get tough:

* he adds unnecessary charges that were hidden in the rental agreement.
* the lift gets turned off randomly, often citing fake power cuts.
* he even turned off the lift for a pregnant tenant as a punishment for another tenant.
* he tries to enter tenants' homes for inspections.
* the building gate is locked 24/7, requiring us to use a common key every time we leave.
* he constantly boasts about his connections with local politicians.
* he doesn’t provide the 200 units of free government electricity that tenants should receive.
* he also doesn’t give us the electricity and water bills.

after six months (the lock-in period), he makes it difficult for tenants to stay and charges one month’s rent from the deposit when they leave. this cycle repeats every six months, allowing him to pocket seven months' rent.

given that he's crafted a tight rental agreement to cover his behavior, is there anything i can do to ensure future tenants know what they’re getting into? there's no online presence or reviews for this place either.

even if this post doesn't lead anywhere, i just thought i'd get it out of my chest.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"ai driven signals making traffic worse have noticed in the last couple months that the ai driven signals have made traffic worse. there are longer waiting times and congestion. 

in basavanagudi firstly, there was no traffic problem before the new signal. now there is a pile up and minimum two signals of waiting.

at the same junction, there is a 20 second green  signal. by the time people put their phones away and start their vehicles the signal is red. 

another major congestion is the minerva circle signal. before the ai signals, the road was more or less free or there was lesser traffic. now there is a traffic jam till sajjan rao circle and minimum wait of 3 signals. 

this has been the route to work for 6 years now but only after the new signals it's become bad.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"got fined because bbmp tracked my garbage bag back to me 😅 so last month i had to leave for my hometown on a saturday morning flight. in my area, bbmp picks dry waste only on wednesday and saturday. i had already missed wednesday’s collection (had office + my roommate was also away in his hometown for 2 weeks).

by saturday morning, there was a good amount of dry waste piled up. so i packed everything neatly into a black bag and left it just outside my house before leaving ,the bbmp guy usually comes around 9 am and picks it up if it’s kept properly there. thought i was doing the sensible thing and left for my trip.

cut to today morning, 7 am ,cops(most probably bbmp marshals as mentioned by someone in comments) show up at my place while i’m still sleeping. they told my roommate that we had dumped waste on the road and we have to pay ₹1000 fine. the funniest part, they even mentioned my girlfriend’s name and said she should pay.

turns out, inside that bag was an old parcel cover with her name and my address. that’s how they traced it back to us. my roommate, still half-asleep, just paid the fine on the spot and then woke me up to narrate the story. what a crazy way to start the day. also will try to be more responsible from now on.

tl;dr: left garbage bag outside on collection day → cops traced it via my gf’s parcel cover → ₹1000 fine.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"the actual problem maybe is not lack of civil sense but not calling out things 

hello everyone 
 
it feels just a hypocritical thing to do is that everybody rants about lack of civil sense in india but simultaneously contributing to that. 
i believe that low civil sense is a problem but it’s not only the problem the actual problem maybe normalisation of bad habits which cause others to suffer in india 

for ex i was just seeing a post of traffic jam in delhi and some other part of india in which delhi side bikers were trying to drive on footpath 
seeing the picture let’s visualise that there is a traffic jam 5 bikers will be definitely standing on the road waiting for the jam to clear but the problem in india is if one biker raises his vehicle on footpath rather then calling him out rest 4 will do the same seeing them others will do the same creating a havoc  

and i feel one the prominent reason indian’s don’t have whatever you call it guts or habit to call out wrong is that kids in india are not merrily taught to ask question but to follow commands. it’s prominently seen everywhere ( schools home tuitions everywhere don’t raises your voice to elders even if they are wrong ) due to which we have adapted it in system we don’t feel it  necessary to call out others or ask questions 


the bikers too who would still choose to stand on road might be bit more educated and have common sense but i bet none of them will call out the bikers on the footpath but they will merrily judge and cuss on them 

truly i feel rather then complaining about the lack of civil sense among we should built enough guts to start calling things out",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"stanza living: a pg nightmare tl;dr: avoid stanza living pgs in bangalore. overpriced tiny rooms (~₹16k+), terrible food, unreliable electricity and water, broken or paid laundry, poor wifi and mobile network, mishandled parcels, hygiene issues, unresolved maintenance problems (like sewage leaks), and zero accountability on refunds. even the staff aren't paid properly. it's a chaotic mess, not worth your money or peace of mind. 

for people who like to go in depth:

to anyone coming to bangalore for work and looking for pgs to stay. please do yourself a favour and stay away from stanza. it's a nightmare living there. here are the reasons why: 

the rooms are incredibly small with rents soaring to 16k per month not including water, electricity and lunch. rent may be more depending on the block you take or if you have a balcony facing a building or natural sun. 

food quality is a joke. often delayed. cutlery barely available. we once had water with yellow food coloring suspended in it for ""dal"".

electricity goes out every other day, generators are used sparingly. hot nights with no fan. hours during day time having trouble with charging laptop. 

there used to be washing machines but they have taken that out. replaced it with a paid service. have to fill out google forms each time to do laundry. who knows what happens with your clothes so ladies please think thrice before you give your clothes

water is an everyday problem. every morning you wake up to no water, they arrange 2 bathrooms for over a 100 people to use.... that's worse than public bathrooms. 

wifi. never works. have to always rely on mobile data. 105gb limit with speeds slower than your grandma trying to walk up stairs. will ask you to disable random mac. i'm not a cybersecurity expert but i think there's a reason we don't share personal device's mac address. 

previous point was about relying on mobile data, that is if you are fortunate enough to get a room where you have network. jio users forget even getting calls. you are doomed 

you can forget everything getting your deposit back, my roommate had to threaten with an fir and only then he got his deposit back. 

any amazon,myntra etc parcels are not kept responsibly. the guards simply do not give a fuck. every week there's someone whose parcel goes missing.

the fridges are not maintained. big fault on residents on this, there are items months beyond expiry date in the fridge. 

the garage of q block has a leakage problem which floods the floor with sewage water. this happened 6months ago and still hasn't been fixed despite multiple complaints. the rcs have been changed thrice but no action has been taken regarding the problem itself 

the staff aren't paid on time either. doesn't affect you but it shows the reality of the situation. 1 block has 6 floors with around 10 rooms in each floor and 2 people sharing a block. that's 120 people each paying around 17k a month.... i wonder where all that money goes

i wish i could post screenshots to prove i'm not just another disgruntled resident who is just angry about something and making shit up.... please let me know where i can post my proof as well",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"now i am realising, behind poor governance is poor journalism based on a small study based on anecdotal evidence and personal experience.

we’ve stayed 34 years of our lives in chandigarh and we could barely associate with anything that we can remotely say as mischievous, misgovernance, that makes you feel utterly powerless and voiceless.

last 18 months, we have been staying in punjab and life is miserably distressing but is full of observations.

1. no electricity for days in cities.
at times, no electricity for 3 days out of the 7 in a week (this is when the demand is low).

absolutely no electricity in villages.
and that’s the norm.

2. traffic jams on not only conventional, interior roads but even on highways connecting cities.

3. no policing.
alcoholics make merry. can stop their vehicles wherever, whenever they want. 
no questions asked.


all this, when we are staying in the constituency of the chief minister, barely 15 kms away from chandigarh.


observation:

there appears to be one important reason behind all this: no journalism whatsoever.

in chandigarh, slightest potholes appear on the front pages of the newspapers, forcing prompt actions.

in punjab, journalistic life is complacent.
making political life even more complacent.

complaints stay unheard for months if not for years.

politics seems mere as a power struggle with no or little emphasis on quality of services being provided to the citizens.

making me realise in this small microcosm:

when journalists falter, 
political class will.


p.s. - 
the private cost of living rises significantly when one lives in a place with poor governance.

since we could afford, we now have massive water filteration system installed as the water quality is said to be poisonous (according to kent ro executive). many people have that now.

we are in the process of buying a personal genset. 
everyone around us have one.

i believe poor or no journalism is a catastrophe beyond ideologies making citizens virtually powerless and only able to exercise episodic accountability every 5 years or so.

bureaucracy becomes hands in gloves in such a scenario.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"bescom cut my electricity when my bill was already paid i came home today to find out that my electricity had been cut (fuse was removed), and everything in my fridge was ruined, to the extreme that i might need to throw it out.

my security guard told me that they had removed the fuse on 12th of october, which makes no sense since i had already paid my previous bill on 20th september. the new bill had been generated on 11th october, and due date was 25th, and i had already paid that as well around 2-3 days ago.

i have my bill and payment receipts on the bescom app for everything. is there any way or hope in complaining? if so, where can i complain? my entire day and next couple of days will he ruined, and i might also need to rent out a fridge if the stench just does not go away. 

--

edit: thanks guys. i faced that asd issue some 3-4 months ago and had paid it back then.
what i suspect is that where i live, if someone else's fuse gets removed by bescom, the security guard removes someone else's fuse who is out of station. and he obviously will never admit it, but he had offered it to us back when ours was removed and we had refused so i would not put it past him.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"how people are surviving india? came for a month long vacation... i used to defend india blindly. i really did.

then i came back for a vacation after years abroad — and this time, i saw things i can’t unsee.

here’s what hit me, point by point:

1. public toilets are still humiliating

i was at kollam beach in kerala. walked almost 20 minutes just to find a toilet. when i finally found one, it was absolutely disgusting. no hygiene, no dignity, no maintenance.

we talk about literacy, development, “smart india”… but we still can’t provide a usable public toilet? that one hurt.

2. the staring made me feel helpless as a husband

people stared at my wife like she wasn’t even a human being — just something to look at.

men stared. women stared. constantly.

i stared back at the men, but what do you do when it feels like the whole crowd is watching you?

when women stared, i couldn’t even react. my wife stopped feeling comfortable just walking. that broke something inside me.

3. delhi pollution doesn’t feel like pollution — it feels like poisoning

we got sick within a week of being in delhi.

the moment you step out of the airport, the air feels heavy and wrong. you can actually see the yellow haze.

people say “aqi is bad” like it’s news. it’s not news anymore. it’s just daily life — and it’s terrifying. uber driver said ""saab bahar se aya hai tum hum to used to ho gaya""

4. inflation has crushed buying power

₹500 today feels like ₹100 a few years ago.

petrol is almost ₹100 per liter.

food, rent, healthcare, education — everything is expensive except human life.

i honestly kept wondering how middle-class families are managing without being mentally exhausted all the time.

5. civic sense feels officially dead

traffic feels like survival mode. no patience. no respect. only horn and ego.

people throw garbage right next to dustbins.

i carried a blinkit paper bag to collect my trash so i could throw it properly later — and people looked at me like i was the weird one.

that’s when it hit me: doing the right thing now feels abnormal.

the hardest part?

i don’t feel angry anymore. i feel sad.

i used to think india was struggling but improving.

now it feels like we’ve just learned to live inside chaos and call it “normal.”

people say: “if you don’t like it, leave.”

but millions don’t have the option to leave.

so i’ll ask the uncomfortable question:

how are people emotionally surviving this every single day?

the pollution, the crowds, the inflation, the staring, the chaos — this isn’t small stuff. this is daily life.

i still love india.

that’s exactly why this trip hurt so much.

reddit,"70% of bangalore’s traffic can be solved if we just enforced “no parking/no stopping” properly every day we lose hours because autos, cabs and buses stop wherever they feel like to pick up/drop (especially on 100 feet road, outer ring road, sarjapur road, etc.), delivery bikes block entire lanes while the rider chats inside an apartment/restaurant.

two dead-simple fixes that need zero new flyovers or tunnel road - 

1. strict enforcement of no-parking/no-stopping zones. tow away vehicles on the spot, ₹2000 fine, no excuses. do this for 30 days straight and behavior will change forever (look at what happened when they started towing on mg road/brigade road a few years ago).
2.  providing good road infrastructure (pothole free roads and walkable footpaths) to allow smooth flow of traffic

am i missing something or would these two things genuinely solve a massive chunk of daily traffic nightmares?",PseudoTopic_0

on top of it, they removed the traffic signal there when the metro construction started. it takes at least six policemen at all times to ensure traffic flow. even then a rogue driver would try to fit their van in a small gap and create a deadlock while hurling abuses at everyone else including the police.

reddit,"mind the gulf - indians are being kept in an alternate reality a good article by saikat majumdar

tldr:

india’s global reputation has plunged: outsiders increasingly lump it with pakistan and bangladesh, rather than as a rising economic or technological power.

a complacent, inward-looking leadership and a sycophantic “godi media” bubble have created a hallucinatory domestic narrative about india’s “massive” economy and vishwaguru status.

pakistan, by contrast, has punched above its weight by communicating more effectively with western media—india’s recent multiparty pr tour only underlines its own failings on the world stage.

once lauded in the 2000s as a tech-savvy “rising asia” alongside china, india now scarcely features in global discussions on trade, soft power or research—especially in cutting-edge fields like ai.

the gap between india’s self-image at home and the sober reality abroad is now so wide that it constitutes either a tragic denial or a grotesque comedy.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"can someone explain the lack of indian artisans? i've travelled to multiple cities in south india and visited many temples. around every temple there are tens if not hundreds of people trying to sell plastic junk or bad copper statues, machine-made and hurtful to the eye. all this stuff is cheap, machine made, some of it coming from aliexpress or other similar sources. what baffles me is how hard these people try to sell their garbage (this is not craft, and this is what this question is about), while not seeing the obvious - there is no demand. many foreign tourists come to india to visit the temples and what the experience mostly is a brutal assault of these rude sellers.

india has a long legacy of highly skilled artisans, masters of their craft. why are not these people in high density places, where tourists would love to buy a high quality souvenir, a statue or painting? where are the indian artists and why are touristic places so suffocatingly oversaturated with low quality ware?

i have met only two exception to this norm. in kochi i entered a textiles shop of high end hand made silk clothing. and in madurai i met an art collector who showed me old sculptures of splendid craftsmanship and artistic accomplishment. these two exceptiond represented 1% of all shops i visited during my trip.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"the scourge of extra fees - convenience/ packaging / transaction/ cash handling! it is just getting murkier. online transactions were all about convenience and savings. however it seems the vendors are feeling wolfish and aren't just satisfied with receiving money for the services they provide. instead they are turning over the transaction costs of the payments mechanism to the customers.

if you order from subway online, they charge like 25 bucks for packaging. isn't the packaging the same as when you go to a store and order a sub? why don't they charge you this fees there? when you order some food online through one of the delivery apps, every pizza chain is charging packaging fees. have you heard of a pizza ever coming in any other way besides the box? if you go order it in store, they'd still pack it in the same box and yet not charge anything extra. if you go dine in a restaurant, you are using their resources including wait staff, furniture, electricity etc and you don't get charged extra fees. yet when you order it online, they slap you with packaging fee. if anything they should be discounting it as the customers are not using the expensive resources. 

i just paid for my kids school online, using a credit card and they slapped in a 1% convenience fees. the credit card fees , the onus of which earlier used to be on the vendor, is now moved on to the customer. shouldn't that be part of your cost? if not, why not add electrical fees, toilet fees, cleaning fees, education fees etc to the tally?

you book a ticket on the indigo app, they want 500-700 as convenience fees.  
you book a ticket on book my show, they slap a hefty fee on you when infact they do get a commission from the movies theatres for getting them business. 

the mantra these days is just add whatever you can as customers will not notice or will not complain as it's a paltry sum of money.

zomato started this ridiculous trend and i think this fee was the biggest contributor for them in their topline, as if getting 35% of the order value from restaurants was not enough.

even amazon could not stay out without tasting this mouth watering treat. 5 bucks an order. wow, when you take 1500 a year to sign for prime membership, why should there be another fee. nowhere in the world amazon can dare to charge this but they are having a free hit in india.

the whole system got infected after one was able to pass it on. 

what are your views on this topic? do you guys this it's fair or is it something that pinches you too.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"satellite town ring road lanes should be 8-16 instead of 4-6 i recently travelled on the strr and started thinking about what its actual purpose of the so-called prestigious strr? the current outer ring road (orr) is already 6 lanes, though it’s been stuck in metro construction chaos for years. but this new strr why make it only 4 to 6 lanes? it should’ve been at least 8 lanes + emergency lanes if we’re really planning for future traffic. it was planned to bypass the heavy vehicles traffic inside the city but with 4 lanes it’s very difficult as majority of the vehicles always occupies both lanes.

i don’t want to sound like i’m comparing cities, but hyderabad’s orr is honestly a state-of-the-art highway. it started over a decade ago(2013) and the way they’ve planned entry/exit points and managed heavy vehicles is just brilliant. you can literally drive smoothly without random trucks blocking the fast lane.it’s currently 8 lanes and additional emergency lane and mostly 2 wheelers are not allowed.

on the other hand, strr already feels half done. two lanes are constantly occupied by heavy trucks, and even the so-called fast lane is often taken by slow-moving vehicles. i’ve travelled only from hoskote to devanahalli, and while some stretches are 6 lanes, others suddenly narrow down to 4. that inconsistency is a real problem.

what’s even more confusing is that strr is already far from the city so land acquisition shouldn’t have been that costly or difficult. why didn’t the government (both state and central) plan this more aggressively, keeping in mind bangalore’s explosive growth?

reddit,"please suggest me some good and affordable non-judgemental psychiatrists for online consultation. major symptoms are listed below in description.  please suggest me some good non-judgemental psychiatrists for online consultation. my location: up east. 
symptoms &amp; problems i'm facing:
- inattentive (no matter how hard i try) 
- forgetful (i forget things while even thinking, and also forget very important things). recalling simple information, life event or words is also very hard for me. 
- unable to focus elsewhere if i know that i have some event/meeting/or something else planned at later time in the day, or next day, till then i keep thinking about the event, and can't do anything else till then. 
- for above point, even planner and reminder don't seem to work. 
- i want to speak a lot, but don't know why i feel very traumatized for speaking. so i stay silent (involuntarily) when others are asking for my opinions... 
- no matter how much i study, i don't seem to remember a thing. as a result, speaking on any topic is a challenge for me. even doing normal conversation has become challenging. i try to talk, and i don't get words and can't recall a single thing so that i can gice answers. speaking simple sentences become too difficult for even simplest of topics. 
- i have to re-read sentences, paragraph very frequently, and even after reading it, i don't seem to remember what i read, then i have to repeat it again. similar for speaking, i don't seem to remember what i'm speaking making me lose track of what to speak next. however, in my mind, i speak, not very fluently but it is still very articulated and well formed. but in real, when i have to speak, i lose my mind and get blank... 
- my brain doesn't seem to register events like, closing water tap, closing electric switch etc. i close electric switch and i have to stare it for a while in order to tell my brain that yes, i literally closed the switch. or else i have to go back to check again whether i closed it or not, i simply can't recall whether i closed the switch and have to go and see in order to be sure. similarly for closing water tap and closing jar lid, i have to repeatedly open and close till my brain accepts that yes, now i closed it. 
- quickly get anxious
depressed for career due to these habits as it is preventing me from giving interviews (which majorly depends on speaking skills) because i get blank and can't speak.
note: english language doesn't seem to be a problem, because speaking in my mother tongue hindi is also quite challenging. often times, i find expressing myself in hindi itself is more challenging than in english, in writing mode. and for speaking, i feel like i am not built for speaking. 

please help. if this is not the right sub-reddit for this question, please advice where can i ask this.

reddit,"was asked to shift the city to bangalore. and then they went extra miles to fire me. hey guys!

i'm still in shock and trying my best to avoid a nervous breakdown. i was living in gurgaon and was looking for a job there. i got an offer from one of the oldest global it companies and was called here. i changed my location and started working here in july. i was finally relieved and everything was going well. i started clearing my debts and took a flat with 1 lac advance and 40k rent. called my family here. i had a probation of six months. last thursday, i was suddenly told that my last working day is monday. i felt a sudden electric shock inside. the same day i got a cylinder connection. i bought a geyser the same morning. ""60% of the salary goes to emi and debts. how would i manage after this?"", i started wondering. there was a pin-drop silence. i regained my senses and asked them how's this possible? my probation period was of 6 months! they told me that they changed my probation period without informing me and they are not satisfied with my performance. i asked them what did i do? can't recall any such things. i even told them that i did not receive any such intimation. they said i was informed in the meetings. but they were just casual instructions! i am in design field and you always receive some inputs or comments. i didn't know this was going to cost me my job. they even sent a mail a week back full of lies about my performance a week back. they told me to treat it as a warning but it was just a feedback mail! 

i broke down in that moment. on the camera. i told them i have a family. a week back i paid the advance plus rent. i requested them some more time. another chance or anything. they said this is a final decision. i explained them it's a miscommunication and i am a good performer but they didn't listen at all. 

i know this happens often but it was one of the orders computer companies and a global brand and there were no layoffs recently. i am still in shock.


tldr: management changed my notice period to 3 months at the end of 3 months without telling me and suddenly told me that i am fired . i didn't plan it and i don't know how i will i survive now.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"what has the government done for you? we all pay taxes—whether rich or poor. income tax, gst on groceries, luxury taxes, property tax, vehicle tax… practically everything we do is taxed. yet, we’ve accepted corruption as part of the system, shrugging it off with, ""yeh chalta hai."" security? basic facilities? forget it. but the next time we see narendra modi, rahul gandhi, or any politician, we’ll fold our hands and greet them like they’ve revolutionized our lives. **are we really this naive?**

let’s do a simple exercise. whether you live in a village, town, or metro, think about your local area (10-20 km radius). **compare the last 15-20 years and ask:**

1. **roads:** are they better, or still riddled with potholes?
2. **water:** availability? quality? still relying on tankers or borewells?
3. **air quality:** has it improved, or is breathing harder now?
4. **medical facilities:** any new hospitals? or are people still traveling miles for treatment?
5. **education:** are government schools/colleges functional, or just crumbling buildings?
6. **cleanliness:** is your area cleaner, or drowning in garbage?
7. **life-changing improvements:** list 5 major upgrades in your area. can you even name one?

for me? nothing has changed. only **worsened.**

**here’s the real kicker:**

\- you get a job? government demands taxes like they’ve earned it for you.

\- you get laid off? no support, no unemployment benefits, no laws protecting you.

\- employer doesn’t pay salaries for months? government stays silent.

\- you get another job? tax cycle restarts. **zero accountability, full entitlement.**

**here’s my reality (and why this system is a scam):**

i was an employee at **brane enterprises**—a company founded by **ramalinga raju** (yes, the satyam scamster who **looted ₹10,000+ crores** and is still living like a king).

* over 10 months of unpaid salaries.
* 95% employees laid off over 6 months.
* thousands of families financially destroyed.
* government’s response? silence.

but guess what? the same government will happily demand taxes the second any of us find another job. no accountability for the rich, no safety net for the rest of us.

this isn’t just my story—it’s the story of millions. the **satyam scam, pmc bank, byju’s**… the list never ends. we fund this system with our taxes, yet we get nothing but exploitation in return.

this is the story of millions—even the **""brightest minds""** of india. we fund this system, yet we’ve stopped demanding better.

**question: what’s the breaking point? when do we stop applauding politicians and start holding them accountable?**

(share your experiences below. let’s see how many can honestly say their area has improved.)",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"worst service experience by edureka forbes aqua-guard i don't know if any of  you randians have had first hand experience with how god awful the after-sale service of edureka forbes aquaguard really is. 

**march 15**: i buy edureka forbes filter. 

**december 1**: my aqua-guard stops working.  i try and examine if it is some problem that i can fix myself. turns out, i can't. the technical problems are still under warranty so i am not really worried. 

**december 3**: i download the edureka forbes app to register complaint. the reviews are all about how no professional is ever assigned to look into the complaints. any how, i register complaint.  

**december 3- december 7**: no professional is assigned for repair. meanwhile, i have to buy endless bisleri bottles just so i could have drinking water at my disposal. 

**december 7:** professional is assigned but the professional refuses to visit me in my off-hours. agrees for a date on saturday. 

**december 9**: professional visits me. tells me that he was not conveyed by edureka forbes that the aqua-guard is actually not working (why else would a customer even lodge a complaint otherwise?), so he does not have the tool to repair the aqua-guard. he video calls someone and shows him the faulty aqua guard. the person on the other end says that the fault lies in the circuit. the circuit is to be changed. 

the technician tells me that it will be another three days before the relevant part is parceled. and i live in mumbai for fucks sake, the company is located in mumbai, less than 30 minutes from where i live. where do you even have to parcel the part from?

meanwhile, he has made a makeshift arrangement for me to have my drinking water, the circuit is bypassed so when i turn on the wall tap the aqua guard is connected to, water comes out via the filter's tap, and i don't really have the technical competence to understand if any filtering is being done at all because the aqua guard is switched off. 

for a company that sells something as critical as a water filter, this is just god-awful service.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"how can we fix bangalore? hey guys, genuine question here &amp; looking for serious replies.

i’ve been living in bangalore for 23 years now. i seriously love this city; i get homesick even if i leave for a few days to another state or country.

there’s something about bangalore that just feels like home.

but at the same time, i feel like the city is falling apart in so many ways. there’s so much potential, but it feels like we’re wasting it.

1. the roads are tiny and congested all the time.
2. insane traffic
3. no proper footpaths.
4. potholes everywhere.
5. one day of rain and half the city is flooded. (i live in hennur, and during the recent floods they had to bring in boats, firetrucks and jcb to get rid of water and last year a building collapsed which caused a construction worked to die and others injured.)
6. i love dogs, but in some areas, the number of street dogs are too much which is not good for humans or the dogs themselves (i’ve seen injured, crippled dogs, once even saw one that was almost skinned. it’s messed up)
7. garbage is just lying around in so many places. the city looks dirty, and there’s no proper system.

(i think the language problem deserves its own post, so skipping that for now. 😅)

what are we doing? we call bangalore the silicon valley of india. startups are booming, tech is growing, people are building great stuff and i think a great environment and urban infrastructure would be encouraging to have all these brilliant people build stuff here.

\&gt; i feel like the people who are in power (mostly boomers) - don’t care.  
they just fill their pockets and move on.  
\&gt; and the older generation of citizens are too used to this mess to even bother.

\&gt; meanwhile, most gen z folks i know are just focused on making money and getting out of here.

so what’s left? who’s supposed to fix all this?  
curious to hear from young people here or anyone in a position to do something.

can we take lessons from any successful city and follow their roadmap?  
do we need a proper movement?  
what’s your honest take on this?

are we just supposed to keep adapting and surviving?  
or is there a way to turn things around?

is anyone here working in urban development, policy, activism, or even just thinking seriously about this stuff? would love to hear from you; especially young people or folks in roles where change is possible.

reddit,"advice for daily 7km office travel in bangalore i'm looking for some advice on commuting options for a daily 7km travel to my office (near hosa road to hsr layout). the bus routes nearby are 1-2km apart from where i stay and to the office too. currently, i’ve tried several options but haven't found a satisfactory solution:

* **rapido, ola, uber**: these are quite costly, especially during peak hours or in traffic. the fares are around rs. 250 for a day and sometimes i face issues with availability.
* **yulu**: i’ve tried yulu bikes, but there are no yulu zones near my place. so, i need to walk around 1.5km to get to the nearest yulu zone. and also sometimes yulu bikes are not reliable as it seems or i don't know to select the proper bike each time.

given these challenges, i'm exploring other options and would appreciate any recommendations or insights. specifically:

1. **other commute options**: are there any alternative methods for daily commuting that i might have overlooked?
2. **second-hand bikes**: would buying a second-hand bike be a viable solution? if so, should i go for an electric bike or a fuel-based one?

thanks in advance!",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"i am ashamed of what india has become it’s going to be a big rant

the young people here honestly don’t seem bothered about what will happen to them later. everyone just wants to leave. i left too, because it got way too tough to stay there.

i tried what i could. i tried talking to people about things, like basic manners, respecting others, or just remembering where we're from while just trying to be decent humans. but no one really seemed interested. most would just stick to what they already believe, their weird sense of pride, and just keep following their religion and politics without thinking.

this country was once famous for smart people and good ideas, but now it feels dirty, actually dirty, and messed up in other ways too. every street and every river, almost any famous place looks like a garbage pile. tourists come and laugh at us. india used to be a spot for people looking for peace and culture, to learn something new. these days, it's scams, trash, noise, and just confusion.

the world used to respect us for being hard-working and kind and spiritual. now it seems like everyone's into shortcuts and cheating. we used to care about spiritual stuff now lots of hate everywhere. be a religion or language . we used to be together. now everyone is fighting over silly and stupid problems like language and religion and political opinions, and and age old issues of ex indian monarchs that should've been forgotten long back.

and the younger folks instead of changing any of this are stuck in easy money apps, cheap timepass, and fake hero stuff. barely anyone cares about the future or the country, or the people living here. watching reels spreading hate.

people treat politicians like they’re gods, the celebrity worship culture has gotten out of hand. we keep saying “bharat mata” but won’t even keep the place clean. we talk about women’s respect but the headlines are filled with awful news every other day.

honestly, i feel ashamed. i do. this is my home. it hurts. this isn’t the india i thought i’d grow up in. this isn’t what i hoped for.

but, at least i can try changing myself. maybe some of us can.

we could stop throwing trash anywhere.
we could wear helmets.
we could actually follow traffic rules.
we could respect women.
we could respect every religion and every person, wherever they’re from.
we could stop fighting about the past.
we could care less about religion, and more about just caring for people.

past is past. what matters now is what we do today and what happens next.

even if we've got fancier tech and better roads, honestly it feels like we’re behind by decades. we’re kind of screwed up as a society. if we don’t fix that, then there’s really no point bragging about progress.

wish people could just feel this, just pause for a second and admit we’re messing up. and we’re probably the only ones who can fix it.

meanwhile, i look at china and other countries and i see them progressing with the manpower they had. we also should have been performing like that, but we are not. the youth of the country has been polarized and is blind of the real issues and has forgotten. who’s the real enemy 


we have become a dogmatic society who will follow political ideology of their favorite film star. we should do something before we become a global joke. starting now, each of us should at least behave in public while going out should read more read more about civilized societies. read books engage in good discussions respectful do not hate woman for being women and  having an opinion. should be a better human and not eve tease  woman who are out in the public we should strive for more.


we should do better",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"why don’t neglected constituencies demand better civic services from their elected leaders? i’ve been thinking about a pattern that’s hard to ignore, especially when you live in or visit different parts of the same city. in one area, you see smooth roads, daily garbage collection, streetlights, and well-planned infrastructure. then you travel just a few kilometers and enter a neighborhood that’s majority muslim or dalit—and suddenly, it’s a completely different world.

in many of these areas, the roads were laid 30–40 years ago and haven’t been touched since. empty plots are used as dumping grounds. trash is everywhere. municipal services like garbage pickup or sewage maintenance are barely functional or totally absent. and these aren’t remote villages—though i understand rural india has its own set of challenges. these are urban neighborhoods, in the same city, under the same municipal administration.

what i genuinely don’t understand is why the people living in these neglected areas don’t demand better from their elected leaders—mlas, mps, corporators. these leaders get elected repeatedly, but basic amenities don’t improve. meanwhile, other localities—often wealthier or with higher levels of education—are clearly being prioritized and maintained.

is this just systemic neglect of marginalized communities? or is there a deeper issue—like a lack of civic awareness, mistrust in governance, or simply having no expectation that anything will ever change?

i’m not blaming anyone. i’m trying to understand: why is there so little visible pressure from the ground up in these neglected urban areas? if both parts of the same city are voting, paying taxes, and living under the same administration, why such drastic inequality?

why aren’t these basic rights being demanded as aggressively as they should be? is it that these communities feel their votes don’t matter, or are they being misled by empty promises?

would love to hear thoughts from people who’ve lived this reality or have insights into how this works politically or socially.

⸻

tldr:
in many indian cities, muslim- and dalit-majority areas have poor infrastructure and lack basic services even decades after roads were first laid. meanwhile, nearby areas are well-maintained. why don’t residents of the neglected areas hold their elected leaders accountable for these conditions?

reddit,"i think its time we respect every one in bangalore rather than being toxic to them.  i am writing based on my experience in bangalore for 27 years, i am 45 have seen bangalore transition in short period of time the reason why we are facing most problem these days. i have stayed in different locations like hsr, rajajinagar, whitefield, sarjapur. its very disheartening to see that city like this is getting famous for wrong reasons.                                                                                                                                                  

the most of the things which is going on between kannadigas and non kanndigas road rages was hugely contributed by autowalas in bangalore. not defending any one here but when you ask some one to speak your language there is way, if you really disrespect and humiliate  some one  you are making them feel bad about your culture. there is nothing wrong in asking some one to speak your language but there are ways to do it.

there times when i see some non kanndigas exploiting this situation and make it look one sided story who act as victims and show it has north vs south kind of things. i witnessed live incident where the car guy almost killed a scooty guy and later  when he reacted, it was shown as kannadiga being attacked on northie guy. we are reacting to these videos without even noticing what's happening behind the scenes. 

i feel its time we analyze things with common sense for both kannadigas and non kannadigas or else the situation would be worsened.",PseudoTopic_0

	1. 2 rs parle-g biscuits are now 5 rs (i mean the quantity)

	2. 5 rs dairy milk used to feel like luxury with that gold wrapper—now even silk doesn’t get the same treatment.

	3. remember when 20 rs was enough for a plate of chat? now you need at least 50.
	4. golgappa at 10 rs per plate? gone are those goli days

	5. shakalaka boom boom pencils with led lights? lost in dark

	6. school days = pe/pt periods. now, schools don’t even bother with proper playgrounds.

	7. those toy magnets? way bigger and better back in the day along with that electricity kind of sound

	8. kids these days don’t even play with laser pointers anymore.

	9. where’s the iconic mango xerox / kaccha mango bite? feels like it vanished.

	10. 1 rs titbits (okay, the name is questionable now) are only available on amazon—not your local paan shop.

	11. remember those crazy, over-the-top ads? kuchhhh bhiiii

	12. atlas cycles with dynamos—where did they go?

and for all my bangaloreans:
	1. konankunte cross used to be a forest. now it’s home to one of the biggest mall (forum).

	2. the humble manasa theatre (plastic chairs and all) is as fancy as a pvr now.

	3. the once-green kanakapura main road is now filled with buildings 

	4. jp nagar and kalyan nagar are basically the new kora

i have a question. i use an kent mineral ro water purifier for a family of 4. i bought it 8 years ago. i had to spend additional money on extended warranty because the motherboard in the top unit used to fail like clockwork after every 6 months. their water candles were unnecessarily expensive and i used buy the ones sold in avenue road and replace them. 

the problem is that the machine needs to be to kept switched on. it automatically shuts down when the water is full in the 5l pressurised tank. if switched off, a kind of vacuum developes in the pipes and the machine takes a long time to start filtering the water. now, there is a lot of waste water being released when the water is getting purified, which i collect to water plants in my house and the apartment, and collect some more to wash my car. 

**however, i am still not happy with the fact that this machine is wasting a lot of water.** 

i wanted to know what kind of water purifier you guys are using and what are its repair and service costs and if it wastes a lot of water.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"should chennai have a directly elected mayor? our monsoon chaos makes me think so. the recent rains in chennai weren’t even that heavy, yet the city practically came to a standstill. roads flooded, traffic jammed, power cuts everywhere—it’s the same old story. a few hours of rain, and the city slips into crisis mode.

it makes you wonder if we are ever truly prepared for the monsoon. year after year, the same promises come up: better stormwater drains, smarter planning, improved coordination. and yet, the coovum river continues to run like a city-wide embarrassment—a sewage channel cutting through chennai’s core, barely touched despite decades of plans and projects.

the real issue seems to be accountability. the chennai mayor’s office is treated more like an extended pr arm of the state government rather than an independent executive body. every initiative feels orchestrated, press conferences are choreographed, and the mayor often ends up playing the role of a city mascot rather than an empowered leader. it’s like watching the office being led around on a leash, with no autonomy to actually fix what’s broken.

what’s even more frustrating is how the state machinery uses every monsoon crisis as an opportunity for social media pr. ministers and political heirs wade through knee-deep water for photo-ops, issue dramatic statements, and post drone shots of “on-ground inspections.” the focus is rarely on fixing systemic failures—just on crafting the right viral moment. while citizens slog through flooded streets, the ruling class turns disaster management into a brand campaign.

in countries like the uk and canada—both parliamentary democracies like india—cities have directly elected mayors who possess genuine authority. london and toronto, for example, give their mayors real mandates to plan, execute, and be held accountable by the people, not the ruling party machinery.

maybe it’s time tamil nadu, and india at large, considers doing the same. a directly elected mayor for chennai could bring much-needed political independence and real accountability to urban governance. or is that too much power for state governments to ever willingly give up?",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"software engineer working at fico lost her life due to landlord’s negligence in bengaluru one of my friends, a 24-year-old software engineer working at fico, tragically lost her life due to a fatal electrical accident (electric shock) in her rented home. the incident reportedly occurred because the landlord failed to fix a known earthing issue.

the accident happened near indiranagar, bengaluru. neighbors heard her screams and immediately called the police, but unfortunately, by the time help arrived, it was already too late.

she was originally from madhya pradesh and had moved to bengaluru trusting it as a tier-1 city where basic safety standards would be ensured. if someone cannot feel safe even inside their own home, then where are we truly safe?

this raises serious questions:

are there proper policies or inspections in place to ensure electrical safety in rental homes?

why are landlords not held accountable for such negligence?

no matter what we do now, she will not come back. but the responsible parties must be held accountable so that such incidents do not happen again to others who leave their hometowns and move to cities like bengaluru for work.

i request the community to please suggest:

what legal steps can be taken to get justice for her?

how can we push for stronger safety checks in rental properties to protect others?

this is not just about one life lost—it is about preventing such tragedies in the future.",PseudoTopic_0

**samyukta kisan morcha and central trade unions call for nationwide rural shutdown and industrial/sectoral strike on february 16.** the bandh/strike is against the anti-farmer anti-worker policies of the modi government.

the bandh/strike will see the participation of students, youth, women, lawyers, professionals, small traders, vehicle operators, journalists, artists, authors, and social and people's movements etc. the call has been endorsed by various women organisations, youth organizations, etc.

**modi government's policies has pushed the farmers and labourers into a terrible tragedy.** rising unemployment, falling income and price rise has wreaked havoc on the workers. public sector units are being privatized. the government, which came to power with the promise of minimum support price and doubling the income of farmers, has betrayed the farmers. agricultural income has declined, and farmers are falling in debt and dying by suicide.

**unemployment has become a national crisis.** the modi government, which came to power with the promise of two crore jobs, has betrayed the youth. permanent jobs are being privatized and contractualized. regular employment is shrinking, while wages are declining in real terms. in 2019, the unemployment rate reached its highest level in 45 years. today, the youth unemployment rate stands at 40%. more than 24 lakh sanctioned government posts are lying vacant, while the government is asking the youth to sell pakoras. through agnipath scheme, the government has pushed the national security and the future of the youth into a crisis.

**economic inequality is at its peak.** the poor and middle class are facing the brunt of inflation, while the government is distributing lakhs of crores of loan waivers and tax cuts to the crony capitalists. in the last three years, when the nation was reeling under covid pandemic and economic downturn, the number of billionaires in india increased from 102 to 169. allegations of corruption and corporate fraud have been covered up, and those raising questions have been silenced. at the same time, domestic savings has fallen to the lowest level in five decades. social security and senior citizen's concessions are being taken away. the price of essential household items, including oil and gas, has risen sharply. meanwhile, hunger and malnutrition has pushed the country to 111th place out of 125 countries in the global hunger index, with three-quarters of the population unable to afford a balanced-diet.

it is worth remembering, that it was the railway strike of 1974 for an 8-hour working day, which shook the indira gandhi government. today, the modi government and corporations are trying to exploit the workers, and increase work hour, instead of reducing it. they rule over the people using a communal agenda.

the bandh/strike will raise the issue of livelihood of farmers and workers. **farmers-workers unity will break the corporate-communal nexus.**",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"the new thorium era and indian pfbr(prototype fast breeder reactor) thorium is the future of nuclear and it is an accepted fact  
however, we cannot use thorium directly, we need to convert it into uranium u-233 by blasting it with neutrons, it will then absorb a neutron then go through beta decay twice and convert into u-233 which is fissile and can be used in nuclear reactors.  
india right now is leading this race, the pfbr(prototype fast breeder reactor) is already ready and is at the last stages of final checks and tests, after these checks are complete in around late 2025, it will reach criticallity, that is fuel loading will start.  
many articles claim that this reactor will only breed more plutonium pu-239 from uranium u-238, which is in fact true, but there is a concrete evidence that thorium th-232 will also be converted into uranium u-233, it is because it has the only operational reactor in the world that is based on u-233(for generating electricity)

also what makes this reactor different from the american one which was tested in late 1950s is that the pfbr is liquid sodium cooled and the american one was molten salt cooled

there is also one more point about this reactor, it is that it breeds more fissile material than it requires as an input.  
in conclusion, we can say that the pfbr will breed plutonium pu-239 from uranium u-238; and it will also breed uranium u-233 from thorium th-232

it will also be the first operational and commercial reactor in the world that will breed u-233 from th-232  

also the pfbr will have a capacity to generate 500mw of energy, after pfbr will be a success, india will make a fleet of fbr's(fast breeder reactors)  
fbr's are india's 2nd stage of nuclear programe",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"personal opinion about why the state government prefer taxi unions over techies according to bbmp reports, bangalore has about 1 crore voters out of its estimated 1.4 crore population. average voter turnout in bangalore is around 51% - 54%. that makes roughly 30% of bangalore population. now, the estimated population of bangalore, most probably doesn't count migrant workers and other unregistered residents. that would bring the percentage further down.

elections are no longer about popularity or majorities approval. they are well calculated, planned fights for parties. it is sad, but it is what it is. for a candidate to win in bangalore, out of the 30% that would vote, with at least 5 popular candidates or parties, guess how much vote percentage is needed! slightly above 6? and who are those 6% of bangalore? and how much is required to be captured to make sure that a particular candidate is lost?

i mean no offence when saying this, the worst bangalore white collars would do is file an online petition or make a social media post. they are disconnected from the grass root population and live in a fancier reality. they wouldn't go to rallies on offers of food or clothes. they wouldn't put up posters or participate in door to door campaigns. maybe donate to their parties, but there are always corporates and other entities who make up majority of the donors. guess who does! 

and the cry for bike taxis is only in bangalore. not even in the nearby districts. guess who is present in all of karnataka? guess how many nom bangaloreans are worried about the state of bangalore and the traffic problems there on a daily basis. guess how many of them reads social media posts about it and goes through online petitions. and guess how many are 6% of bangalore population compared to the overall population of karnataka. sunday mornings are good for fun math. i will leave it to you.

ofcourse, the white collars pay income tax. that goes to the centre. and guess how much of it the state gets back as its share! all 5 southern states and maharashtra for that matter. an average techie in bangalore is essentially good only for the amount of money he/she spend out of his income. and the 200rs professional tax per month. what is the best way to make them spend money earned in bangalore in bangalore? by making the essentials cost more. and transport is something that makes top of the list. having it companies in bangalore doesn't help it directly. it is about the business around them. cab, hotels, pubs, real estate etc. 

why would people who doesn't vote and who doesn't do grass root level work for them, who doesn't spend as much as they can would matter to the government? i am not worried about the downvotes on unpopular opinion, but please try to understand the reality and think about what can you do to make your voice heard.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"waste dumping in empty plot the plot next to our house is empty. has been for the last 15 years. people just use it to dump all their garbage. we have gotten it cleaned from our own money 2-3 times but people just can’t understand. the garbage collector also comes regularly every week. why can’t people just give their waste to him? we have a beautiful house in a good neighbourhood but it’s so embarrassing to live next to a pile of garbage. once someone even set fire there at night. and now there is so much garbage it has piled upto our compound wall. is there anything we can do about this??

also the owner of that plot is some old guy who doesn’t give a shit. we have requested him so many times to build a wall around the plot but he  doesn’t reply to us properly. can we build a wall without his written permission??? will that be illegal???",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"best &amp; worst of my experiences while driving 6300 kms from pune-dehradun-lucknow-delhi-pune some special mentions of my best and worst experiences during this recently concluded road trip spanning 6300 kms across 7 states, 130 cities and consuming 450 litres of petrol on honda wrv:

best city: indore

mind totally blown away, while staying for 12 hrs at indore. amazing vibes of this city, something out of the world. not a big city, neither small, just the right size. vibrant night life, majestic malls, superb roads, neat and clean ambience, and some extraordinary food. people are nice, considerate, patience and big hearted. will definitely visit there again, and stay for atleast a week. 

worst city: gwalior

i mean, i couldn't find roads there. only potholes. it seems roads were build around the potholes there. pathetic condition. had a plan to visit the massive fort there, but the roads prevented me. sad. 

best food: indore

night time food adventure at sarafa bazaar and a short visit to the pub at malhar mall left a lasting impression. the quality and variety of food at sarafa bazar was outstanding. 

best highway: agra-lucknow yamuna expressway

301 kms of pure bliss. average speed 120, with no hiccups. no pots, smooth road, wide arena, and seamless flow. 

worst highway: entire mp

the biggest problem on the highways in mp is not potholes.. i mean, after a point of time, you realise the meaning of your life, and the potholes' role in solving the mystery of life. but the biggest problem was cows. its cows everywhere on the national highways! saw atleast 500 cows during 700-odd kms of drive in-and-around gwalior, chambal, guna, indore. cows simply roaming on the national highways, everywhere. literally everywhere. 

most scenic highway

nashik-pune expressway, handsdown. it's still being made, but the scenery along the highway is mesmerising. right from indore to nashik, the entire route is very scenic, filled with tribal areas, vast untouched land and dense forests. 

pune-lonawala-mumbai expressway is no doubt breath-taking, but nashik-pune expressway is something different. in mp, the highways near kuno wildlife on gwalior-indore route was also beautiful, but the bad roads made it look bad. 

best budget hotel: udaipur.

when you steal a deal under 2000 bucks and get a large, ancient haveli and swimming pool all for yourself, then its pure delight. icing on the cake was the story about ghosts and haunted hallways there. more details later!

most restless traffic: surat.

very erratic, rash and fast traffic. i don't think traffic rules are appreciated there!

most considerate traffic cops: jaipur

cops stopped our car. there was no puc. i told them that honda showroom guys told no puc is needed for first year. they told puc is needed after 6 months of buying a new car in rajasthan. but i bought from pune, i told them. but your car is allegedly causing pollution in rajasthan, they told. damn. kya karna hai bataiye, i pleaded. acha jao, bahut door se aa rhe ho, bahut door jaana hai. par, rajasthan ghoom ke jaana, they made sure to made me smile.

scary phase: unstoppable rain at agra-mathura stretch, chambal valley and between gwalior-indore. the rain drops were lashing out like they were bullets. had to stop the car, and wait. huge currents of water sweeping across the highways like it's a river. dark cloud, almost night-like scene at evening 3, lightning, and suddenly in-shorts notifying me that red alert has been announced at the very spot where i was waiting for the rain to stop. it was a bit scary!

special thanks to brand honda.

drove these 6300 kms on honda wrv, and a superb experience all this while. no unexpected breakdowns, tyre puncture or any over-heating issue. drove for 5-6 hours non-stop with full ac, at 150 kms highest speed, curves, valleys and hills. 

seamless driving experience. visited couple of honda workshops at lucknow and had a very great experience there as well. honda is definitely a brand you can trust.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"my thoughts after visiting a foreign country recently i have lived in usa and dubai before this, and while i did feel the difference between those places and india, it never affected me much, because well 
usa is the richest country on earth and dubai is rich from oil. but recently i travelled to a couple of asian countries and it gave me a jolt, as to how far behind we are. 

i recently visited malaysia and singapore. out of this, singapore is classified as a developed country based on all criteria used by international organizations, it is also similar to dubai and usa for the high cost of living. 

but malaysia - although it meets only 2/3 of the criteria to be a developed country, it feels like it has met all criteria. 
inspite of the lower size of economy ($1.47 trillion compared to 14 trillion of india - ppp gdp), their per capita gni is $14,700 which classifies it as a high-income country. 
it is also the only asean country to have met ""very high human development"" status. 

india per capita gni is $2,540 which means two things - our wealth is extremely concentrated among a small number of people. we need to increase our per capita income 6x times before we can call ourselves a developed country. 

100% of south asian countries were classified as low-income countries in 1987, whereas this share has fallen to just 13% in 2023. which means while our neighbors were becoming developed we are stuck in a poor rut. 

while in malaysia, i felt like i was in an alternate india, which has somehow become developed nation in another universe. they were under colonial rule till around the same time we became independent.

49% of people used to be in poverty. in about two decades, they brought down that number to 17%, without fudging with the statistics. today, less than 1 percent of people are poor there. 

every place i went was clean, even a roadside public toilet. 

no honking on the roads, which were without potholes. people waiting calmly in queues and signals. petrol costs around 50 rupees. that too without any ethanol. 

and the country was low on living costs. i looked at real estate prices and they were surprisingly affordable compared to india. 

a prime minister was caught for corruption, he was convicted by the court and is in jail now. he was fined $10 million and police confiscated his assets worth hundreds of millions. we can't even imagine such a thing happening in india. our governments are filled with convicts and criminals on all sides. 

i kept wondering, is such a future possible for india? we seem to be a country where everybody is on their own. education, healthcare, retirement support, and everything have to be paid by the individual with not much support from the government. after paying the taxes, i have to save and pay for all these myself. there is no wonder we have civic sense failures - we are all in survival mode all the time. 

especially after covid, the income has stagnated, and the gap between the rich and poor has widened. economy is said to be going in a k shape, with the poor becoming poorer and rich becoming richer. 

would we have done better if we went with an eu-style union of states? 

did we commit a stupidity by going for a non-alignment stand in our formative years?

is there a chance india can develop to the level of these countries?",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"felt like i'm on another planet going out of my house after two weeks of working from home i was a little bit sick and didn't want to squander my limited sick leaves so decided to work from home for two weeks. the difference is night and day. 

earlier, i used to work in hybrid shifts of two days working from the office in a week. but never had a chance to experience a long continuous duration of working from home for 2 full weeks.

2 weeks of no chaos, full silence, nobody there to bother you, no shitty roads, no traffic, no honking, no cows or dogs or cats pooping on the road, no beggars or scammers, no terrible air quality, no hustle and scuffle and bustle of delhi, no pathetic roads filled with potholes, no trash on the street - nothing. it symbolically felt like living in a heaven. 

and after two weeks of working from home, now going out feels like night and day again. as they say - there is no middle ground in india. you either love it or you absolutely hate it. you're back to the chaos, shitty streets, cow poop on streets, terrible roads, pathetic air quality, trash everywhere, overpopulation everywhere, spitting on the roads everywhere, urinating everywhere, unorganised chaos everywhere and it feels like a post apocalyptic hell again. 

no wonder why shitty bosses/companies don't want people to work from home. you not only save money from avoiding commuting but most importantly you don't have to see everything bad being thrown at your face every single day. not sure what the situation with other major cities is but i speculate it's pretty much the same. delhi has become an absolute shithole from a beautiful city which it was when i was going up. tbh, if i wasn't too broke, i would have gone to any other major city or maybe even tier 2/3 city.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"unpopular opinion: india needs a complete rehaul on so many levels but it will never happen, a keyboard warrior's rant 1. except forthe parliamant which is a different story altogether, the infrastructure of almost all other government level facilities is in shatters. 

government hospitals:

take the kolkata incident for example, there was no rest room, the poor doctor was on a 36 hour shift and had to resort to seminar room for rest. not to forget that there were no cctv cameras.

there is a on contract person who is so high on his connections and abuse of power that he is allowed to do whatever he wants and had no remorse whatsoever on being caught.

the principal resigns and is handled a new responsibility within 24 hours.

the state gov, central gov. will not pay any heed to improve the infrastructure or even hear the complaints of the poor doctors.

the protests will go on and on until the doctors get tired and poor chaps return to their jobs with a sad heart.

  
sports:

sunil chettri said this, so have many others, there is no process or a system to identify or nurture the right talent in india.

most of the sportspersons are from very humble backgrounds (read poor) no well earning parent wants their child to enroll for any sports or pursue a career because they know that there is a high chance that their child is destined for failure or not being able to achieve greatness.

china has 170k stadiums compared to india which does not even have 1/10th

china's sports budget for 2023 was 26560 cr vs india which is at 3452 cr

indian sports is full of politics

all politicians, private investores come to laud the athletes once they have achieved something. up until then, it is the athlete's own journey. 

vinesh phogat was struggling for her visa before the olympics.

the athletes protested with full force last year but still his son is the head of the body.

do you really think there is any seriousness, no there is not



business

time and again, so many international level entrepreneurs and business house have said that it is so so so difficult to do business in india. musk said this once and so many others.

  
per capita income

it is all numbers and stats but on ground level, the poor is getting poorer by each passing day.

  
3rd biggest economy

we talk about becoming the 3rd biggest economy, bullshit!  
we can become one because of the n number of states that we have and their contribution, not because we are doing something extraordinary.  
  
we compete with japan, england etc who are 1/100th the size of our country.

sad part is that we feel no shame whatsoever in boasting facts like these.



civil infrastructure

i live in a gurgaon locality where the rents are about 50k for a good 2bhk but come rains, the reality pops up with waterlogging everywhere. we are in a metro city for god sake. the local mla is a corrupt, money hoarder politician who keeps on hopping parties and i am 100% sure he has 0 clue about what are the problems faced by people of the city, the cm was the same, he had to be changed. 

not only gurugram, every other city is the same. what i want to cry my eyes out about is the fact no one fucking no one has this common sense that monsoons create a havoc every year so lets for once lets get the gutters cleaned before monsoons. noone does it in delhi, gurgaon or any other city nearby.

but yes, everyone wants to be a part of the photo op. kejriwal sucks, so does bjp and i will not mention congress cos they are no different.

2. how is the safety and security around this place?

3. water problems? 

4. does this area have places to hangout over the weekends, like pubs or movie theaters or does one have to go to other places?

reddit,"now we'll have to pay tolls to use flyovers and underpasses in bengaluru? really? gba has apparently proposed charging tolls or ""user fees"" for using new flyovers, underpasses and elevated corridors in the city.

let that sink in, we already pay road tax, fuel tax, cess, and still dodge crater-sized potholes every monsoon. now they want us to pay again to use infrastructure that should've been part of our basic right to mobility?

is this something that can even be justified, or just another example of how public infra in blr is being treated like a private revenue stream?",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"more to orr traffic &amp; blr- rant/opinion it might be long so feel free to skim through.

# about traffic

i usually take the bus—not that it’s great but i'd rather have mental peace than the stress of driving in blr. the point is, when i took my scooter to work today, not only did i have a horrible start to the day but i felt so bad for people **driving their own vehicles** to work in that route (daily). the roads are a mess-the potholes, the dust, the poorly planned underpasses and the illegal encroachment. everything is so so chaotic and people are still fighting traffic &amp; time- riding on footpaths, shatters from construction work, over rocks and debris to get to office in time. it’s literally to go and work!

# lifestyle and downgrade

how low have our standards fallen? it makes me furious and also **sad** that we pay so much in taxes yet endure a subpar lifestyle. karnataka has the highest rto tax, and this is what we get. people working 8-9 hours a day, commuting for 3 hours, and sleeping &lt; 8 hours are made to believe they’re hustling—when in reality, it's an unhealthy lifestyle that's been glorified. issues like cardiac arrest, hair loss, and diabetes can easily be traced back to this. we’re heading in the wrong direction.

# improving traffic

on top of it all, the bus and metro fare hike? it's baffling! while we know there are obvious solutions to improving traffic like wfh, wider roads, faster work, better planning etc, the no-brainer, win-win solution is to improve **public transport.** yes, public transport can single-handedly improve traffic in this city. metro will take time to see widespread usage but bmtc buses are an immediate available solution.

# further on bmtc busses to improve traffic

there's a vajra (ac) bus **500-ca** which runs between banashankari &lt;&gt; itpl via jayanagar, btm, silk board, hsr bda, agara, bellandur, kadubeesanahalli, mahadevapura and so on. it covers a good chunk of dense residential and workplace hubs. they also run every 5-10 mins i think. then what's the problem? that is **not enough.** the seats are filled as it leaves banashankari (which is good) but even by the time it reaches btm or silk board, it's packed to the brim- leaving hardly any room to stand. commuters board with frustration and disappointment knowing they have another 1-1.5 hours of travel ahead without **space to stand**!

increasing the frequency of these buses will easily attract more footfall- especially on this route where people have the affluence to pay for comfort (ac) and convenience. it may be difficult to tackle in other locations but the orr and sarjapur road- where most companies are located—should be a straightforward, revenue-friendly, and eco-conscious solution.

# koramangala to sarjapur road

this road is supposed to be better than orr, yet no one talks about how bad it really is. from st. john's to jakkasandra, it's mostly decent—wide roads with only a few potholes and construction debris. but that doesn’t mean it gets a free pass forever. two nearly invisible speed breakers—one at st. francis and another near the water tank—are accidents waiting to happen. in daylight, they’re hard to spot; at night, they’re practically invisible. i’ve seen countless close calls, and once, the auto i was in got rear-ended by a thar because the driver **couldn’t see the speed bump**!

beyond jakkasandra, the situation gets worse—potholes, half-finished construction, and dust so thick it single-handedly lowers the aqi. the road starts wide but keeps narrowing—a highway at the start, a goat path by the time you reach agara. from agara to sarjapur signal, it's downright dreadful. the service road beside the flyover barely has space for a single car at a time. what were they even thinking when they built this? these are some of the busiest roads in the city, yet they’re built like an afterthought. kudos to development!

# conclusion tl;dr- a disheartening realisation

i’m just very sad today. i usually steer clear of these but today has been a sinking mix of frustration, disappointment and helplessness. blaming the city, the departments, the government, the bosses, their bosses, the companies and so on. i relate to ambi from the movie anniyan/aparichit. we thought he was a loser but today we’re all taking the l’s. if anyone reading this has the knowledge, sources and resources to fight for the bare minimums, you will have the support of millions of taxpayers in blr.

reddit,"the cesspool of hypocrisy that has permeated the privileged urban middle and upper-middle classes in our country. this is a very long rant/post, but i just wanted this out of my system. i just couldn't take it anymore with my relatives, and the people i am surrounded by and their hypocrisy. there is no tldr. use chatgpt if you need to, or ignore the post.

-------

a couple of months ago, i had an interesting conversation with my uncle. he was praising the government left and right because of how the vande bharat trains are changing the face of the indian railways by bringing in world-class, if not beyond world-class, level of travel to india. 

***'aur kya chahiye? look at the development!'***

fast forward to the present, he and the rest of my privileged family are engaged in a conversation spewing vitriol, and classist &amp; casteist rage at the people vandalizing the trains in north india. labels such as 'uncivilized', 'gawaars', 'chapri', and more are freely being plastered on these people. it is happening in social media too. videos of overcrowded compartments and passengers storming into reserved coaches have become viral with most of the privileged section of our society seeing this as nothing more than the unruly behavior of uncivilized villagers. there are even questions about our taxes being wasted on the rpf and grp and whatnot letting our country 'descend into lawlessness.'

let us step back for a moment and look at this situation from a different perspective. these privileged people venting out their frustration with the overcrowded trains is not unfounded, but the way they are doing it reveals a deeper layer of their psyche. instead of holding the government responsible [for cutting general and sleeper coaches](https://www.financialexpress.com/business/railways-indian-railways-goes-premium-with-more-ac-coaches-per-train-key-details-inside-3417508/) while prioritizing 'world-class' premium services like vande bharat trains, they direct their rage at [people who have no options.](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/soaring-train-fares-shrinking-sleeper-coaches-add-to-passenger-woes/article67545165.ece) the outrage isn't just about the congestion. it is about having to share a space with people they think don't belong there.

my relatives, especially that uncle, who rarely travels by train have the audacity to talk about second-hand embarrassment over these incidents, all while keeping mum on [the policies that created this situation](https://frontline.thehindu.com/the-nation/indian-railways-on-the-wrong-track-darjeeling-train-accident-balasore-triple-tragedy-passenger-safety-kavach/article68362231.ece). the same bhakts whining about the 'lawlessness' now, never once spoke about the reduction of the general coaches, [the lack of safety](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/analysis-rail-safety-off-track-as-train-incidents-surge-6793663), [the fucking selfie booths of our baby](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/centre-spent-162-cr-on-pms-3d-selfie-photo-booths-across-50-railway-stations-says-rti-reply/article67676762.ece). they remained silent while the ticket prices shot up and the people who can barely afford it are not even ensured basic dignity.

this outrage about 'lawlessness' and lack of safety never was a point of concern when sanghi mobs, backed by the state, [were attacking people in broad daylight](https://scroll.in/article/1062772/they-saw-a-muslim-name-and-attacked-how-hindutva-mobs-ran-amok-on-mira-road), [lynching people](https://www.thehindu.com/specials/text-and-context/states-lax-response-to-lynching/article67138604.ece), [enforcing caste hierarchy](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/up-rajasthan-mp-top-in-cases-of-atrocities-on-dalits-report/article68670887.ece) and [violence through religious terror](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-58406194). the only time they suddenly become aware of 'law and order' is when the same people who were handed impunity by the government, to do whatever they want began disrupting their own comfort. when these same groups go about [attacking interfaith couples](https://cjp.org.in/2024-love-jihad-as-a-socio-political-tool-caste-endogamy-and-hindutvas-dominance-over-gender-and-social-boundaries-in-india/l), [spreading terror in the name of culture and religion](https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/rising-tide-of-atrocities-against-dalits-2850523), and more, they do not cry for 'civic sense.' but when these people start breaking rules in their spaces, whether it is ac trains, malls, or gated communities, then it suddenly becomes a problem. like their pawpaw says, 'hypocrisy ki bhi seema hoti hain.'

the government's obsession with vande bharat and the bullet train shows how messed up their priorities are. these trains are turned into an event with the prime baby of our country being hyped up so much as if he himself built these trains with his own hands. when incidents like these happen, the news media will be silent and these bhakts will say 'you expect him to take care of everything?' these idiots don't realize that the government is doing nothing to solve the problems of the majority of the population. these lodus have spent more than a decade excusing and even justifying policies that strip the underprivileged of basic dignity. failures of the state are treated as 'minor inconveniences' while blaming those most affected by them or demonizing oppressed communities. the state of despair we are in is because when they had to demand accountability, they chose to defend the people in power. it is easy to shit on the desperation of the poor on social media from the comfort of your home, but it takes willful ignorance to turn a blind eye to the people who put them in that situation.

to clarify, i am not saying that the vandalism by the people attacking the trains is justified, but i feel they are not doing this *only* out of unruliness, but also because the system has given them no choice. general coaches are packed to the brim, trains are running hours behind schedule, and sanitation is non-existent, but ***'woh dekho! bullet train.'***

unsurprisingly, both groups (the ones whining about uncivilized people, and the ones engaging in vandalism), remain among the government's most loyal supporters. they tirelessly make excuses, spread disinformation, defend the government's blatant anti-poor policies, etc. both groups have been convinced that 'something good is happening somewhere. it may not be happening to or around me, but it is happening.' my neighbor, who was in tears when the hindus in bangladesh were being attacked and killed, is silent about his hindu brothers and sisters in the kumbh mela. he is silent about the government quietly brushing that and the delhi station stampede under the rug.

the state has provided both these groups with plenty of enemies — minorities, oppressed communities, intellectuals, or anyone who questions the government. the politicians have successfully created an environment of 'us vs them' while they happily fill their coffers and give themselves and their families and friends a grand life.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"dad doesn't care about us one bit right now we are living in a house (on rent - 7k/month ) which doesn't have a 24/7 water supply we have to fill it in buckets and all every morning to use for the rest of the day. can't use the tanks on the roof (different story for that). the house doesn't have a western toilet. my mom has severe back pain it's a nightmare for her to use the washroom.

every time we ask him to find a better place, he just changes the topic, straight away ignore sometimes or says stuff like ""these problems are everywhere"" or ""good houses will be too expensive"" but the thing is we were living in a better place before this (11k rent) which atleast had a 24/7 water supply. and he earns like 70k a month, plus its a govt job so expenses like medical and all are already covered, and before all this we used to get govt quarters so we never even paid rent before. my sister earns 25k per month and all our expenses like clothes or eating in a restaurant, she pays for it. ( she even wants to contribute to house rent but my parents don't allow her to).

there are still 2 years left before i graduate and get a job. i am trying my best to find internships and do side hustles, what not.

but i don't know what my dad is going to do with all this money he'll save, he really really likes to save money everywhere. i remember that when we were kids and we went to shirdi, the shop was selling water bottles for 15 rs, so he said that we'll buy water bottle from the next shop, and his next shop where the water bottle was of 10 rs came at the end of day. me, my mom and my sister were so fucking thirsty for the whole day. i just hate him more whenever i remember this.

i don't know if i can get help here, but i just wanted to let my feelings out. although, please provide any solutions you might have.",PseudoTopic_0

the only ola electric service center in unkal, hubli is shut down. the staff have vanished. phones are off. no updates. no answers. just a line of helpless, angry customers showing up every day, hoping for some miracle.

people have been waiting for months to get back their scooters. these aren’t cheap machines — we trusted ola and now we’re just left hanging? this is mental torture.

we’ve emailed, tweeted, tagged, called — nothing. absolute silence from ola.

posting this here in bangalore in hopes that someone at ola hq sees this and takes action. you’ve built a brand — don’t destroy it by treating tier-2 cities like they don’t matter.

reddit,"we need more people being open and sharing valuable insight from their profession and educated other it’s like we(india) have become educated robots producing machine but they don’t pay us we pay them to go there and once our children are born there we are no more indian. 

we indian love slaves. for use it is once an employee always an employee. we don’t see other people hard work and the torture they have been through to change their self and mind you change is tough pill to swallow. 

indian are very bad at everything( i hate my self for this) we have world class specs to ignore like garbage and benefiting hobbies and many more and the main problems is again slavery you don’t give poor money rich don’t give middle class money and this cycle will always continue. 

i am a muslim but this caste system is still running in our blood we all love to judge. what’s your percentage? what do you do for living? we should never judge person but if you know he is weak you should be he older brother and keep guiding him where and how you learn thing to be better off this world and how to learn that 

“how to learn” one how the most important things to teach other. you guide and immature person but never guide a mature person please. teach him how he can do it, let him do it and see if he can do it don’t judge him there too. i want to be entrepreneur, i want to open factory or i want business which can be opened for minimum and can be large scale business but no one will tell you how you can do it even if they have some insight they will say oh this oh that.

youtube shorts and reels are just destroying you all. always think you are paying some random vlogger or uneducated rat money who will never even take a selfie with you and note this down a selfie is nothing but a prove of you wasted time so much time for least dominant person (i don’t know how to explain that). you could have praised someone who is showing you knowledge and i also get it being a youtube is a skill and the name of the game is how can hook you up they most professional people don’t have time for hooking you up . 


there are still 1000more problem i can share(maybe i will write more) but we need each other. your friend are not the close one your family is not the close one. your india is not the close one. your world is not the close one. the real close one is there person who want to learn your expertise or experience. you can’t teach anyone who doesn’t want to you can only give a opinion that’s all",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"does anyone else feel crushed by how broken our system is? i’m 22, female, from a fairly liberal family. but honestly? living here is still exhausting.
every day the news is rape, molestation, domestic violence. and instead of outrage at the perpetrators, society blames the women. even women themselves do it. it’s crushing.
casteism is still alive and kicking. people pretend it’s gone in cities, but the moment marriage comes up, suddenly “honour” matters. inter-caste couples get harassed or even killed and people online support honour killings. how is love, the most basic human connection, something to punish?
sex education? a joke here. the second someone brings it up, people scream “against our culture.” meanwhile, every kid has porn on their phone shaping toxic, unrealistic ideas about relationships. studies show proper sex ed reduces assaults and builds healthier attitudes. but here, shame counts as “culture.”
then there’s purity culture. men’s virginity? doesn’t matter. women’s virginity? apparently her whole worth. the hypocrisy is unbearable.
and being a woman here is constant paranoia,
watching what i wear, checking behind me at night ,parents panicking if i’m late.
tell me, how is this freedom?
zooming out, the bigger picture is just as bleak. politicians don’t care. roads are broken, the air is poison, school fees ridiculous, and even government exams (like ssc) are riddled with scams. thousands of students’ futures at stake, and they can’t even conduct an exam properly. meanwhile, the rich climb higher while the middle class and poor suffocate.
and as citizens, we’re no better. we trash roads, dump garbage in rivers we call “sacred,” blast loudspeakers without caring. i saw a girl online get abused just for calling out noise pollution. near my house, prayers and religious songs blast at 5 am every morning. neighbours hate it, but no one dares complain ,because religion always trumps reason.
instead of moving forward with science, we’re sliding back into superstition. politicians teaching kids that hanuman was the first astronaut. black magic, pseudoscience, rituals  this is what we’re passing to the next generation. how are we supposed to compete globally with this mindset?
layer after layer of dysfunction.
and it feels like no one truly loves this country. patriotism only shows up on republic day, independence day, or during an india pakistan match. but when it comes to actually improving things? silence.
i’m not saying this out of nowhere. a lot comes from what i see around me, plus interviews and news from channels like the print on youtube, creators like umrah husain, and countless other videos/social media.
so i’m asking,
 do you ever feel this hopelessness about the country?
 and if yes, how do you cope? because right now, it feels crushing for me and what can we as the present generation ,do to improve the situation?",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"why is having maids so normalized in indian households compared to western countries? something that has always made me curious is how common it is for indian households to rely on maids. whether it’s for cleaning utensils, sweeping and mopping, or even cooking food, many indian families, even middle-class ones, hire maids for daily tasks.

is it because we are too lazy to do it ourselves? or is it that our work-life balance is so off that we just don’t have the time? either way, it feels like having maids has become a cultural default.

in western countries, yes, people do hire cleaners or housekeepers, but it’s far less frequent and usually only by wealthier families. in contrast, in india, even households with limited income often have maids coming in daily. why is that?

of course, affordability plays a big role. the cost of hiring maids in india is low, and there’s a large supply of domestic workers. but i feel like there’s more to the story than just economics.

in the west, people are more self-reliant when it comes to household work. fixing small electrical issues, plumbing problems, assembling furniture, cleaning the house thoroughly — these are things many people just know how to do. that self-reliance also seems to translate into more respect for those professions, because they understand what the work actually involves.

here in india, i’ve seen people blatantly bargain with electricians, plumbers, and especially maids, even when the difference is just 100 rupees — something that might not matter much to them but could mean a lot to the worker. is this lack of respect because we haven’t done these tasks ourselves and don’t understand the value of the labor?

is this cultural? economic? a mix of both? would love to hear how others see this situation.

edit: p.s it was my opinion and would love to have an open discussion to understand more about this topic.

all views are appreciated to have a better understanding.

have a nice day!",PseudoTopic_0

we do have backups but if i am between a client call and power goes off then i m fucked!
because it takes 5 to 15 mins for power to come back and router to restart.  phone internet is not reliable at our low floor.

i know many are facing this problem but in my line where i deal with international clients,  if we show signs of poor internet infrastructure then we are fucked!

recently,  we started this exercise in our whatsapp group to broadcast power cuts to get an idea which areas still have power. as of now it seems jp nagar, btm are neglected much more.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"advice for first time visiting india hi everyone 
i will be traveling to india, my first time going there, in two weeks. took care of visa, purchased mosquito bracelets, went through a whole list of needed items. any advice so i don’t get sick with improper water or food? i am beyond excited but heard so many people saying to be careful so i would like advice of someone who’s been there multiple times. i am portuguese (not sure it will help to know background)


update: i appreciate all your comments and i have been through all of them! i will definitely tell you my opinion when i’m back! thank you for all the time you took to answer and advise me. 🙏🏽

update now that i am back in us: 
so i took all your advice recommendations and this is my experience: i didn’t really need odomos or mosquito bracelets. i forgot to use them most of the time and had no problem with it, so i’d say that was surprisingly great! first impressions of india as soon as i landed was the smell of the dirt but i was very happy about it tho. people are awesome, kind, always willing to help you and yes, they did look at me all the time and i even had people asking to take pictures with me (not sure why 🤣). i made sure yo only drink bottled water like i was told, but occasionally you’d visit someone’s house and they would come with tap water and i thought it to be rude to pass it so i drank it. luckily i was fine. i forgot to use bottled water to brush teeth but didnt encounter a problem. 
now when i left ahmedabad for agra that’s when the problems started. i was scammed left and right and i am embarrassed to admit it now. i should have known better. my husband says he was surprised i was so good at bargaining because i noticed we were constantly being asked for prices in dollars. if you’re a tourist and you think india is cheap think again!! we noticed everyone’s was always trying to get us a guide anywhere we would go and, we would accept but that came with a never ending process of taking us to shops to basically force you into purchasing things. i wish i knew better but by the time i realized that was a mo i had already spend a bit much.
taj was insanely gorgeous and so worth it. fatehpur sikri was one of my favorite places to visit actually. 
vrindavan ended up being chaotic. i had so many expectations for it i guess, but we were swamped left and right by beggars and was really really hard to move around. i had planned a whole day there but left after 1pm because you can’t really go anywhere without being harassed. at that point i was feeling a little disappointed already. it was hard for me as an individual wanting to pray and share time with the lord to be completely harassed and constantly being asked for donations. 
jaipur was stunning but the same thing happened. our driver got as a guide (don’t even know why since we never requested one in the first place ) and that guide showed us the amer fort but then took us into some shops where we spend easily 3 hours trying to get out of there and constantly saying we didn’t want anything but being constantly harassed. this is my one and only complaint about india. i know we’re all trying to make a living but it’s just so forceful that it’s almost impossible to detangle yourself from those money suckers. 

everything else i absolutely loved. the cows roaming in the middle of the street, the monkeys , the dogs, the peacocks. i was in awe with every single thing. i loved the rickshaw rides, how people were so friendly. if you keep yourself away from commerce places you’ll be fine, that’s my main take away 🤣

and someone told me “please don’t fly air india” now i see why!!! never again i will be using air india. we purchased extra leg room seats but of course they assigned us new ones. i mean…no! just never again! 

if i would return to india? i probably would if i had a better airline and could visit places without being harassed. it was an amazing experience though.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"electric appliance and their extended warranty from croma just brought ac yesterday from croma with their extended warranty called zipcare. they charged me 5999 for 2 free service in first year and unlimited service and 2 gas refills for 4 years. i got ac for 41k lg 1 ton 2025 model. total with discount and emi of 8 months i got it for 46k with extended warranty. now after coming home i saw bill and got confused as i thought price that they mention there on display was without their warranty but it was including zipcare which was around 46k, actual price of ac unit of same model is 41k offline and 39k online but online extended warranty is costing 9999. i think it was a dumb move to buy extended warranty as i think it is of no use. i have never brought ac in my life, this will be first ac in our home. i feel sad now as i think i was ripped off with this warranty thing. is it really worth to buy extended warranty or i got played? will this extended warranty from zipcare be helpful in future years? is it necessary to service ac twice or trice in a year? by any chance can i get refund from croma?",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"they are burning everything down... yesterday, i saw people burning a big area for building apartment/society. they burned trees and plants for more than 6 hours. instead of burning them, they could have moved the trees to another place. even in my smaller city(tier 3 city), they move trees carefully when they're building smart cities projects. why don't they do the same in bangalore? all this just to sell expensive apartments, even though it could have water/climate problems in the future. and they're not even planting new trees to make up for the ones they destroyed.

seeing trees burning for over 6 hours made me worry. i never used to think much about the weather or trees before. but now, with water and weather problems, i'm not sure where we're headed.",PseudoTopic_0

it can’t be generic like infrastructure, it should be specific. if it’s infrastructure related, something like metro connectivity for the whole city or regular buses or wider roads. it can’t be just “fix infrastructure”.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"are there even any real part time jobs apart from scams. i am currently on third month of my internship program which lasts for about a year. since the cost of the entire internship has to come off from my pocket and being in early twenties, i felt a embarrassed asking for money from my parents each and every month for rent, food and travel. so, i decided to search for part time typing or designing jobs since i have a laptop and already have little experience doing those.
all the videos in youtube, google searches only ended up wasting my time. nearly most of them i contacted with wanted me to deposit money in some shady website promising me huge returns. one of them even ended up being a pyramid scheme where the person wanted me to recommend his product to my friends and family for a cut of the margin. i for the least wanted to earn a little bit enough for food or rent but that path has led me nowhere. 
i started learning how to trade stocks, but due to short amount of time i get in between from coming to work and getting to do my daily chores, i had to stop that. also due to the fact that i was bombarded with ads from trading accounts from instagram who promised to make me a millionaire in 30 years asking me to invest in the stocks they recommend. 
could someone recommend me any legit sites for data entry or part time typing jobs. i have a little bit of experience in word, excel, powerpoint ( i won the best presentation award when i was in my college for my powerpoint presentation). i also have knowledge on photoshop, lightroom and illustrator, a little bit on video editing, colour grading and such. does anyone know any good sites or place where i could put these skills to use???",PseudoTopic_0

a quick search on google says this is not an isolated event.

reddit,"bbmp, is there a frequent digger loyalty program? 🤡 i’ve had an office on **hsr layout, 9th main rd** for the past 11 months, and in that time the road outside has been dug up **at least 10 times**. no exaggeration — every **2–3 weeks** some crew arrives, tears it up, half-patches it, and vanishes… until the next mysterious digging squad shows up.

at this point, i’m convinced bbmp is running a **“dig 10 times, get 1 free”** scheme. the road is basically a subscription service — you never *own* it, you’re just renting smooth asphalt for a few days before it gets recycled.

the patchwork is so bad it looks like minecraft in real life. add a bit of rain and it turns into a mud pool with potholes as a surprise bonus level.

reddit,"this is the ""developing"" india i don't even know if this is called ""developing"". 
i have spent my 18 years living in this country and in this particular state and city. 
it's heart breaking because it's not the city as people think it is. 
my particular city where i live it should not even be called city because it's none like one. 
roads are not at all developed, littrely a road was built after 5 years and not even month went by its has several holes in it and when i say it's several i mean it. light gets cutoff 5 times a day and sometimes 8 hours went by and there is no electricity, if call to complain or even ask why electricity is gone no one picks up the call. 
traffic is hell, venders occupy half of the street and other half is covered byfreep illegal parking, not a single vehicle is moved or even given warning from toe company. 
traffic rules are nothing over here and trains are packed like overflowing garbage can. 
there is no sopt of cleanliness. 
government is sleeping. 
i had little upi fraud occur to me 3 months ago, it was not a large amount only 600₹ but my friends and family told me to report it as amount doesn't matter, so i reported it knowing fully well it's not going to be solved but whatever. few days go by and my bank account is blocked,when called cyber crime no one littrely no one picked up the call, i called more than 10 times still no answer or even callbback, thank god for a good police officer who told me what to do and helped to unblock my bank account. he was shocked too of why my bank account was blocked? anyways my fraudsters has yanked around 50 thousands money from several people thank god i didn't go that deep and stopped at 600 only. i have his every details from phone number to upi id and even his bank name and transaction id. whatever but this is not at all ""developing"". 
edit : for those who think i am blaming one political parties than no. my city is not even run by ang major political party. it's not under bjp or even congress. it's entirely different partie which is ruling for 40 years. and yes there was introduction and winning of other parties. result we faced very bad electricity as well as water cut off. i am not on side of any parties neither bjp nor congress because for me both are same. no matter which parties rules our situation is not going to change unless we voice our opinion.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"what is the harsh reality of being a 3rd tier college student?  
as a mechanical, civil, and electrical engineering student, you consider yourself elite than the cs/it guys (because they get passing marks easily, and you get more backlogs).

you daydream about clearing the gate examination and landing up in a psu, only to realize a few years later that the cs/it guys have jobs in a corporate environment, while you are operating a machine at a manufacturing unit, dealing with the labors on a construction site or maintaining the electrical components of some machines.

 few choose autocad/plc/scada and later become sales executives because of lower pay. your heart breaks once more - shit, these it guys got girls, chill-college-life, and now a corporate lifestyle. and what did i get? these dust, sweat, and fumes? and that too with a pay scale equivalent to a laborer? ohh, god! you’re so unfair.
 
everyone around you has landed in the college because they could not get a good rank in engineering entrance exams. those guys might not be studious, but teach you to enjoy life with minimum resources. you make a lot of lifetime friends in the hostel.

you’ll find everyone talking about how the future of engineering in india is degrading and how all of us are not going to even get a job of more than 10–15k (which you don’t believe in, till you reach the final year and reality hits you hard).

those campus-placed candidate’s photos you saw on the brochures and hoardings of your college, many of them never got a joining after their so-called campus placement (at least in my college it was so).
mechanical, civil and electrical guys don’t only consider their course structure to be tougher than others, but also convince each other why don’t cs/it girls deserve them.

 brotherhood is at par with the other branches because there are no girls in between. no girl, no fight. 😂😂
you don’t focus on extra-curricular activities much and hence don’t participate or help in organizing them. you lose out more and more chances of your mingle life. also to realize later, how those missed pdp classes, not doing public speaking courses, and ‘other than the study stuff’ are now killing your chances of getting a well-paying job.

you see everyone dreaming for gate, but no one clearing it. you’re depressed. you see someone boasting to refuse a job giving less than 30k salary as fresher and eventually see the same person settling for 10k (justifying they’re doing that job for experience, not money). you’re depressed more.

the couple you thought would be marrying in the future, are separated after college because suddenly the girl found that her father wants a well-settled preferably government employee. and the boy was busy feeding and caring for her baby throughout the college tenure, now baby has grown up and wants a shona who can provide her a better life, because she has compromised a lot in her life being a girl, and doesn’t want to live the same life.

since you have already wasted 4 years of engineering, you would now convince your parents about how the situation of the private sector is too bad in india, and a good government job can be secured by giving ssc/ibps exams in no time, kyuki english aur maths hi to hai, wo bhi basic.

you land up in mukherjee nagar, you see half your college there already. you sit for hours in parks doing long discussions and relive the hostel life in another form. the list and the vicious circle of life go on and on. some of you take the banking path and find a job sooner, some go behind ssc and the results are finalized in another 4 years. some chose ph.d. path, some upsc. some continue, some have to leave in-between. the lifecycle continues depending on one’s financial condition and family support.

though nobody fails at life and eventually finds a way of living, sooner or later. and now you’ve grown up and stop comparing your life with others, because realities of life keep breaking many of your stereotypes (beliefs) time-to-time. you now become mature and start respecting all jobs - be it a shop owner or a school teacher.

ps - these are my personal experience of coming from a tier 3 college in ncr. readers may agree or disagree depending on their personal journey, financial situations, and available guidance. i’m neither criticizing any branch nor promoting any. and yes, i’m from mechanical, so know the pain. 😂😂",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"one hour of rain = 12+ hours of powercut i guess this is an old story. it's such an old story that it's a non-story. it rained around 7:30pm yesterday. light wind. of course there was a power cut. it stopped raining at 10:00 pm or so. but the power didn't come back when the rain stopped.

when i call the bescom call centre, they're already so fed up of people in my area complaining that they gave me the subdivision officer's number. when i call the subdivision officer, he gives me the same old tired excuse of trees falling on the transmission lines, wires tripping because of rain, or whatever. he vaguely promises at 11 that the power will be restored at 12. and he talks as if i'm asking for his kidney by asking him the all-important questions. but at the stroke of midnight, the power doesn't return, and doesn't return, and doesn't return...

before everyone tells me to buy an inverter, that's not an option to me because i'm unsure of how much longer i'll be staying in bangalore. and given the length of such power cuts, even inverters will run out.

i know i can't do anything because i'm powerless in this scenario. government &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; people. just wanted to vent. that's all. thande thande paani mein nahana didn't improve my mood or snap me out of my sleep deprivation either.

ps: i'd appreciate it if a journalist would try to root around and figure out what the hell is happening in sarjapura. that's where i stay. rural bangalore and all, i know. but there's a limit to bescom being pathetic. juicy stories about scams and corruption are particularly welcome.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"economic shock therapy for bangalore water crisis  solve bengaluru water crisis by privatizing water supply and bswbb!


unpopular idea - government doesn't know how to fix water problems in city of bengaluru.

1. bengaluru is the tech hub of india and the city will grow evermore in the future. cities public infrastructure has not been able to keep up.

if public infrastructure is bad in bangalore the city will loose it's attractiveness as the indian it hub.

many indian cities like hyderabad, coimbatore, chennai have been competing to get these investments. bangalore must not loose this competitiveness.

2. government is extremely inefficient in managing any resource. bswbb has basically failed in it's duties.

just remember the days when all we had was ambassador cars, bsnl telecom and air india. how bad was services provided by them. these companies were extension of the government with monopoly status.

3. privatization made india what it is. we were a struggling country - after 1990s we had a massive economic boom thanks to privatization.

3. the indian growth story we know exists because of lpg reforms by pm mr. narasimha rao.

liberalisation, privatization and globalisation improved our country.

4. when government was monopoly every sector was performing badly - private competition made the country a lot better in every aspect.

5. across india power utilities have been privatized - e.g reliance and tata power is supplying electricity efficiently to whole of delhi. torrent power has been managing electricity supply to city of ahmedabad, gujarat.

poor will never suffer - delhi power is managed by private companies. but government regulates it and subsidises power for poor. infact for the poor, the most affordable power is available in delhi (it's free for some units!) despite being managed by private company.

5. sanitation is outsourced - entire chennai city waste is efficiently managed by a spanish company urbaser sumeet.

6. even metro rail has been successfully outsourced - hyderabad metro is operated by kelios a french company.

7. many cities like bangalore where the government struggled with providing water &amp; sanitation outsourced the same to private sector, which made the services so much.

8. nagpur, maharashtra had really terrible water supply system.

veolia a french company took over the nagpur cities water supply - waste has been reduced, water was made safe, water supply and infrastructure drastically improved.

private sector invests in the correct infrastructure, reduces wastes and leakages and manages the supply properly.

9. there are many such examples where privatization and outsourcing of water supply actually improved services.

10. government could explore privatizing water supply and making bswbb a regulator than a supplier or even dismantling the incapable water utility company.

bswbb has proven incompetence. there is no point in paying huge salaries to government bureaucrats just to see the tanker owners making all the money while bangalore eternally suffers.

if not full fledged privatization, a staged privatization with ppp model could work.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"rahul gandhi and the truth people refuse to accept look at what is happening in this country right now. ed raids are everywhere. central agencies are being used like personal weapons by the bjp government. anyone who openly speaks against bjp ends up detained, booked, or sitting in jail for months or years without conviction, without trial, and often without solid proof. sonam wangchuk. arvind kejriwal. and many others. this is not random. this is a clear pattern.

if you are not in bjp and you become a real political threat, cases suddenly appear. either you get harassed, jailed, or pressured into joining bjp. we have seen this play out repeatedly. denying it is just being dishonest.

now ask yourself one simple question. if rahul gandhi was actually corrupt, if he had serious scams behind him, do you honestly believe bjp would leave him alone? this is the same government that uses ed and cbi against students, activists, journalists, and opposition chief ministers. but somehow rahul gandhi, who directly challenges them nationwide, is still not in jail. why? because they cannot touch him legally.

and please stop with this lazy nonsense that he is bjp’s biggest asset. cut that crap. everyone knows he hurts bjp politically. the bharat jodo yatra changed the narrative on the ground. his vote chori claims may not be fully accepted by everyone, but they planted doubt in people’s minds. even a little doubt is dangerous for a party in power. bjp knows that very well.

if even a small amount of solid proof existed, rahul gandhi would have been locked up long ago. just like others who dared to speak against the government. the fact that he is not says everything.

you can dislike him. you can disagree with his politics. but pretending this means nothing is pure intellectual dishonesty. rahul gandhi has to be clean, truthful, and honest to the core. otherwise the bjp would have destroyed him by now.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"indian road quality  for all the chest thumping our gov likes to do about how many km of new road infrastructure is being built everyday, there's another side to it - the terrible quality of the roads.

for the civil engineers/urban planners out there - can you comment on why indian road quality is so terrible?

does it just have to do with corruption in awarding tenders/contracts and the contractors doing subpar work so as to keep getting more work to repair said subpar work? or is the general quality of our roadwork just inferior? are we unable to make good roads that last? or is there another reason?

i'm from mumbai, so for example on the so called great development that is the coastal highway project - after just a few months of use - there is already patchwork visible on the highway which is due to some repairs/retarring for whatever reason. and this is meant to be a highway quality road, i'm not even talking about normal roads which in almost all cases are filled with potholes, bumps, manhole covers, etc etc which basically ensures you cannot have a smooth ride. the mumbai - vapi (south gujarat) stretch of the national highway is another example of just an absolute mess. i'm sure there are tons of other examples all over india.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"the street i live on has become an absolute garbage dump i live in a street in mahadevapura, it is a pretty busy street directly connecting to orr. it was quite clean till a couple of months ago, then one or two people started throwing garbage at the street corner and now it is absolutely filled with garbage every night on both sides. what can i do about it? is there someone i can contact from bbmp? ask them to place a garbage bin or something? i need to find a way to fix this!",PseudoTopic_0
reddit,"are there any cities in india which are as good as nordic/western european ones? i have travelled across several european (schengen &amp; nordic ones), north american, latam(brazil, argentina, uruguay and mexico), south africa, morocco, namibia, ghana, china,malaysia and uae countries during last 6 years and spent atleast a month in each of these countries. 

the amount of filth, poor , polluted environment, inefficient waste management, poor hygiene levels, poor public transportation in vast majority of cities in india is staggering. even though i was born and raised in india but after spending last 6 years abroad and returning back i felt like i am 100 years behind. 

the only thing we are ahead right now is 
payment systems (cashless transaction) 
which is impeccable all over india. apart from that most cities are not livable for an average person. 

heck even cities in african countries are way better and clean. 

i have lived in pune, mumbai, hyderabad and bangalore. these cities are disgusting and builders have gone mad constructing building one after the other leaving no roads, no space for parking, potholes and whatnot. 

concluding, are there any cities in india which are as good as nordic/western european ones ?",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"gurgaon is the worst place i've ever been to basically i'm from uttarakhand, not the mountainous part but the plains one. i've been  into fair share of large cities like gwalior, meerut, jabalpur, ujjain, jammu, haridwar, dehradun, jaipur, agra, bhopal, prayagraj and many more. all this rant is based on the experiences of these cities as well.

a week ago, i came to gurgaon to give some exams. what i'd heard about gurgaon was that it is a very huge city, a sister of delhi, booming with infrastructural growth, is one of the most developed cities of india.

but when i came here, the reality is all together very different.

the first problem i encountered after coming down here was the attitude of ola/uber auto drivers. literally no one accepted the booking as it was a bit inside the enclave. don't understand this behavior. i somehow managed to find an auto. i specifically told the driver to take that one particular route, but he fucked up and stopped at some goddamn locality. took me literally 2 hours to get to the house i'm staying in, while it should've taken only 15-30 minutes.

next, it's just so hot in here. it was like i've been shoved into a boiling oven. i've been to many cities, including the hot and semi-arid places like gwalior, meerut, etc. but the story here was something else. it was as if i was walking in the middle of a f\*cking desert.

and the road here are literally nonexistent. where are the roads? all i found was some off-road paths laded with potholes, gravel and sand. so much construction and no one bothers to clear their sh\*t up. just gravel and sand all over the place. the roads here literally made me cry.

and don't even get me to start on the public transport system. it's abysmal, to say the least. a person have to depend entirely on ola/uber to go from one place to another. bus stops are just for showpiece.

this morning, it rained heavily. as expected, the streets waterlogged very quickly. understandable. but the condition was the same even after more than 10 hours since rain. it rained in the morning, i went to give paper in the afternoon at 2, returned at 5 and the condition was just the same. where the hell is the drainage system? why there are no drains? you have just covered the entire ground with concrete, had built no drains. do you expect that the water will magically disappear?

there's no beauty in this city. no trees, no eye-pleasing architecture. just tall concrete towers everywhere. i literally couldn't find a single garbage bin and sulabh shauchalayas. i live near rezang la road, and what else i can say about this except that, it's horrible, truly very horrible.

what the hell is local government doing? don't they know of the problems of the common citizens? why are they sleeping? i understand people have their own compulsion to live in this sh\*thole, but i couldn't stand a minute of it. maybe i'll be living in this in the future, but i pray to god that such day will never come.

it's a horrible, horrible city. zero sexiness, zero vibes, zero beauty.

sorry for the long rant. i just wanted to lash out and take out my frustration with this city.

**edit**: w.r.t.crime, i just keep my head down and go on with my business. it feels as if people here are high on weed or something. they would just stop their car in the middle of the road, just so that someone could hop in the car. you glare at them, and be prepared to look into the barrel of a gun. normally, i use autos and bikes, but someday i took the scooty (of the person i'm living with) and i seriously had to be extra 200% alert. in other places, you bump into someone, you'll try to solve the matter amicably, in gurgaon, you'll be dead before you open your mouth. so much cases of road rages.

this being said, my experiences with people here has been a tad good up until now. have not met such kind of people til now, and hope to not meet them till i stay here. the people i've met, were generally helpful and polite. guess, i'm lucky in this aspect.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"in new india, every problem is a fault of the citizens of late india has mastered one trick: every disaster is a failure of the people, never a failure of power, policy, or profit. the government shrugs, billionaires get richer, and the public has been slowly trained to blame itself and each other:

- a terrorist attack: it is the people on the inside from a certain community who are the villains, not the intelligence and security failure that enabled it.

- dirty cities: it is people who “lack civic sense,” not municipal bodies that fail to build working sanitation systems.

- pollution: it is farmers burning stubble, not corporations, construction mafias, vehicle lobbies and weak environmental enforcement.

- unemployment: it is the laziness of youth, not an education system that fails to create real employable skills or dignified jobs.

- crimes against women: it is the woman’s clothes and behavior, not a broken policing system, slow courts, and zero fear of punishment.

- train and aircraft accidents: it is sabotage or human error, not chronic underinvestment, mismanagement, and political neglect of rail safety.

- overcrowded trains: it is “ticketless freeloaders,” not rising fares, stagnant capacity, and collapsed public transport planning.

- potholes and floods: it is careless drivers and illegal homes, not corrupt contractors, drainage failures, and zero urban accountability.

- medical bankruptcies: it is poor financial planning, not a healthcare system gutted by privatization and price gouging.

- housing and slums: it is people choosing to live badly, not the complete failure of affordable housing policy in cities.

if everything is always the fault of the people, then the people in power never have to answer for anything. power never apologizes. it never pays. it never corrects itself. the public is trained to self-flagellate while institutions rot in plain sight. what we live under is an ideology that protects failure at the top by manufacturing guilt at the bottom.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"unveiling the truth behind rmz ecoworld/adarsh's traffic woes and environmental clearances residents and office goers of rmz ecoworld /adarsh palm retreat have been a victim of traffic chaos for quite some time now. while the issue is not new, recent revelations surrounding the environmental clearance approvals for a new building behind honeywell building have raised questions about the truthfulness of certain claims made by the developer of the tech park. in this blog post, we will examine two specific lies that came to light during the approval process and discuss the potential consequences of these falsehoods for the community. this is a series of posts exposing the reasons for poor urban planning in the bellandur area.

**untruth 1: alleged tech park vehicle access**

one of the builder's claims that raised eyebrows during the environmental clearance process was the assertion that adarsh villas allow tech park vehicles to enter and exit from their private villa compound. while it is true that the roads in question are public roads encroached upon by the villa association as private roads, it has never been the case that non-villa vehicles were allowed to use them. this claim was seemingly made to show that traffic was already being distributed across multiple roads within the complex.

however, the reality is that this access has never been a reality, and residents have always maintained the exclusivity of these roads for villa owners. to resolve the traffic issue, the responsible authorities should consider enforcing the claimed access and ensure that it becomes a reality, thereby potentially alleviating the traffic problems in the area.

**untruth 2: the nonexistent road through saul kere**

another claim made by the builder to bolster their case for environmental clearances was the existence of a road through saul kere (lake). this, too, was a falsehood. there is no such road, and this lie further underscores the lack of transparency in the approval process. the builder's intent may have been to suggest that traffic would be distributed through a network of roads, but in reality, the entire tech park area has only two main roads, making the traffic issue even more pressing.

&amp;#x200b;

[the unfiltered untruths : screengrab of approval documents page 301. \(link below\)](https://preview.redd.it/in4hgnk9qgyb1.png?width=951&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ee80c74a39706e3ca63ceec7d263bf62ba45bec9)

**the current state of affairs**

as of now, the new building project is already in progress, and it seems that there is no oversight or accountability in place to verify the accuracy of the claims made during the approval process. the community remains in the dark about the potential consequences of these falsehoods on their lives and the already problematic traffic situation.

**what' s the name of the authority that approved this traffic analysis ?**

in the central government, there exists a committee responsible for evaluating proposals and granting approval to various projects during board meetings. this committee operates under the jurisdiction of the ministry of environment, forest and climate change, government of india.the committee extensively discussed and examined several aspects during their deliberations and documented these in the meeting minutes. topics covered included the vicinity of lakes, ecological considerations, b-kharab land usage, diversion of drainage channels, permits from the bangalore water supply and sewerage board (bwssb), and many others. however, it is noteworthy that the committee overlooked the crucial factor of analyzing the potential impact on human lives due to traffic-related factors.  **perhaps if they had accurately represented that only two roads connect to the tech park instead of falsely claiming the existence of four roads, questions about the matter might have arisen.** for detailed information on committee's decision, you can refer to page 149 of the meeting minutes, where the project received its approval. link is below.

&amp;#x200b;

**opportunity to make the situation better**

in the face of these revelations, it is essential to consider whether it is more prudent to help the builder by making lie 1 a reality, by forcing villa association to **allow non-villa vehicles to use the roads through adarsh villas**. this could potentially ease the traffic situation. may be this is the only opportunity for the public and the builder to make the situation better.  courts have always emphasized that roads with in a layout are not private. but its unsure how villa owners have been claiming that those private roads. however, it's equally important to hold the builder accountable for the untruths they told during the approval process. transparency and adherence to the facts are crucial in such large developments, as they impact the lives of countless residents and commuters. personally, i am not against development but i am all for well planned and sustainable development.

reddit,"need help regarding the street dogs. before you guys start commenting, 

"" leave your house and go somewhere else and let them live peacefully""

"" feed them, they will behave""

""give them shelter""

please understand what i'm trying to say, if u have already made up your mind to show hate then please skip. i myself have a golden  at home and truly am a dog lover.

&amp;#x200b;

there are 10 street dogs in my area, 9 grown-ups and 1 puppy ( around 4-5 months in age). these dogs are treated with a lot of care by the people in my locality, given food 3 times a day, when it rains we let them into our houses and even when it is too hot, i myself go and give them water. it's all good in the day time, the problem starts in the night and even people in my locality are not able to take it anymore. 

these dogs are fed around 10:00-10:30ish by the people and by 11:30 idk what ends up happening to these dogs, they start barking.  just imagine 10 dogs barking at the same time all night ! they literally look at each other and start barking. this barking has become such a normal thing here, around 5 months back a thief had come and had robbed footwear from almost all households, they barked as usual, no one even cared as it was a daily thing. this has become a major issue now, not only me, but a lot of people in my locality are looking at these dogs are a burden. literally all nights have become sleepless nights. from 11:30pm to 4am of continuous barking of 10 dogs is too much to take lightly. people are taking a decision not to feed these dogs so they will go away, but i am sure that is not the case. someone with a solution please help me out !",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"🚨 scam alert: nestaway eats up deposits with fake charges! 🚨 i rented a flat through zenify in 2017 (later acquired by nestaway).
	•	rent started at ~₹28k + ₹5k maintenance.
	•	by 2024, it was ~₹37,436 + ₹7,200.
	•	deposit: ₹1.54 lakh.
the owner asked me to vacate as they were moving back in. nestaway and i agreed to vacate by end of july. i vacated on 28th july and handed over keys on 31st july.
now nestaway wants to rob me blind:
	•	₹37,436 for painting 🤯
	•	₹7,000 for cleaning (on top of painting)
	•	₹7,000 for lights/holders (some never worked when i moved in!)
	•	₹7,246 “notice period” charge — even though i moved out on time!
	•	₹4,000 faucet that costs ₹600 on amazon (proof: https://www.amazon.in/omplast-inc-health-faucet-gun/dp/b072vhshtz)
	•	plus they added 1 extra day rent because their guy “forgot” to update key handover.
total deductions = ~₹70,000 😡.and even after 15+ days, no refund of the balance.
this seems to be nestaway’s business model:
	1	take big deposits.
	2	add random inflated charges when you vacate.
	3	delay refunds until tenants give up.
nestaway = legalized scam.please avoid them at all costs.
anyone else faced this? thinking of going consumer court — ₹70k is not small money.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"dear bengaluru administration dear bengaluru administration, if you really want to make our lives better – focus on these instead of endless new plans

bengaluru folks, hear me out. we keep seeing flashy announcements, new ""plans,"" and more tech park permissions while basic life in this city feels stuck. if the administration genuinely wants to make quality of life better, here are the real issues most of us deal with every single day:

stop approving new tech park buildings until existing infrastructure can handle it. enough is enough – our city is bursting at the seams already.finish the metro on time. we don’t need more maps and press conferences, we need functional connections that actually reduce traffic.

fix potholes and improve roads. it's embarrassing that the so-called “it capital of india” feels like an off-road adventure the moment it rains.

autos should run on meter. tired of paying ""app-based fares"" without an app. simple enforcement can solve daily harassment for lakhs of commuters.

encourage carpooling apps and last-mile solutions (bike taxis, shared autos). these are practical, cost-effective, and eco-friendly – just support them, don’t ban them.

policing must focus on crime prevention and community trust. friendly police and  safer neighborhoods… we shouldn't fear reporting issues.

dedicated ambulance lanes. traffic jams should not decide someone’s life or death.

and let’s add a few more:
public toilets, proper garbage disposal, and stricter noise pollution checks. (ever heard an illegal loudspeaker at 2 am? we all have.)

green cover protection. stop cutting trees like they’re obstacles instead of what keeps this city livable.

please, stop adding to the chaos and fix what we already have.what do you guys think? what’s the one change you’d want to see tomorrow that would instantly improve life in this city?",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"stay away from moto (motorola)  on january 29th, 2023, i purchased a moto g52 smartphone along with the extended warranty and complete mobile protection plan as suggested by flipkart. however, after only 5 months of use, a green line suddenly appeared on the right side of the phone's display. interestingly, the line would fade out after a minute of usage.

to avoid voiding the warranty, i decided not to get the phone repaired immediately from a local repair shop (barely 5 mins away) and instead contacted flipkart. their executive advised me to return the phone, considering it was still under warranty (excluding the additional warranties and complete protection plan i purchased).

i carefully packaged the product, ensuring it was securely wrapped, and handed it over to the bluedart executive who came to collect it. the phone was returned in its original packaging, as i had concerns about the lack of a cardboard box for transportation. i specifically used the original case for the return.

this occurred on july 11th. today, july 15th, i received an email from protect\_jeeves stating that the device has ""liquid damage"" and is now considered out of warranty. to make matters worse, they are requesting an additional 1000 rupees to fix it.

this situation is highly unacceptable because not only is the device still under warranty, but i also paid an extra 600 rupees to ensure its safety. i can confidently state that the device was never exposed to water or any other liquid, as jeeves claims it is. there was not a single instance where it was introduced to such an environment. it is extremely disappointing and frankly insulting that this issue is being attributed to my own error.

&amp;#x200b;

the problem i initially encountered was a light green line appearing on the right side of the display, which would fade away after a minute of usage. since i handed over the product to the bluedart executive in its original casing, i have no knowledge of how they handled the device during transit. a simple google search would show you that this is a recurring issue with the g52 model.

this is the exact issue that i faced: [https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/moto-g-5g-2022/getting-green-line-issue-on-moto-g52/m-p/5188329](https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/moto-g-5g-2022/getting-green-line-issue-on-moto-g52/m-p/5188329) [https://www.lifewire.com/fix-green-line-android-phone-5509491](https://www.lifewire.com/fix-green-line-android-phone-5509491)

reddit,"learning to drive hi guys, so as the title says, i'm learning to drive dad's car, a 2013 hyundai i10 in kolkata. i'm 20 days in, and i've learnt most of the technical aspects of driving and can drive reasonably decently on a straight, smooth road with minimal traffic. however i face the following problems. some of these are general in nature, some pertain specifically to indian conditions.

i panic when other vehicles honk relentlessly. especially at a signal. i jam the car into first gear, with an intention of slowly rolling forward, but the second the signal turns green, everyone honks, and i panic and in my panic i am very likely to let the clutch go too quickly, stalling the engine and therefore blocking the lane and making everything exponentially worse.

i am terrible at dealing with bumpers. i come way too close to the bumper when i brake suddenly to avoid crossing it too fast, putting me at risk of collision from behind. i am unable to estimate exactly how much i ought to press my clutch pedal to move over the bumper at a controlled speed, and either end up stalling my engine or crossing it waay too fast.

i am unable to fluidly shift gears in several situations. i can do so decently when accelerating on a straight road, but i often forget to shift downwards when i must suddenly decelerate, for example when a cycle comes in front of me out of nowhere or the car enters a massive pothole/bumper. 

i am bad at dealing with sharp bends. i overestimate/underestimate precisely how much i have to turn, and in kolkata's dead narrow, sharp af bends, i often end up hitting my rear view of walls and stuff. 
i often go at a snail slow pace in bends, and end up blocking the roads for other cars. 

in the same line, i am terrible at swerving in sudden situations. when a dumb pedestrian/dog/cycle/bike comes in front of me, i am bad at estimating how much to swerve and end up hitting something in the opposite direction.

i am also very bad with u turns, and end up doing them very slowly and block other cars. 

another thing that i find very hard is dealing with slightly sloping surfaces. unless i press the accelerator much, the car rolls backward or the engine stops (note that i also forget to shift to a lower gear), and when i do press the accelerator, it often goes out of control.

i panic in general in tough situations, and even in situations not too tough for a decent driver. if i look in the rear view mirror and see a truck thundering towards me, i panic. if there is a fucking ricksha in front of me at the time, i panic even more. if i am driving on, say, a road with a bazaar on the sides, i panic. if i am in a narrow lane and see a vehicle coming in the opposite direction, i panic. any of these situations requires you to calmly negotiate your circumstances  but i simply shut down completely and make the dumbest mistakes. 

i often forget to use my horn and that lands me in bad situations especially in sharp bends where you can't see the other side.

whenever i focus particularly on getting any of these specific things correct, i forget and mess up basic things. most of these things i know what to do on a technical level, but the problems are in my head. i either forget, or am unable to estimate things or i panic. often driving feels like too many things to handle and keep track of at the same time. 
how do i get over these problems and become confident quickly?",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"sick of bangalore traffic - time to fix bangalore traffic is honestly the worst. we’re all stuck wasting hours daily, surrounded by cars, bikes, and chaos. it feels like there’s no real solution, so most of us just stick to our own vehicles and make the problem worse. it’s not just about the time we waste but also the stress and environmental impact of having so many private vehicles on the roads

here’s what i’m thinking: a **private ac bus service** that actually works for us.

* pick-ups and drop-offs at spots you can easily walk to
* comfy 12/21-seater buses
* no fancy app (yet)—just a simple whatsapp or google form to book

if enough people are into this, we’ll expand it properly, with more features and better routes.

but first, i need to know. would you use this, how much would you pay per ride, what routes or areas should we start with?

and yeah, if there’s any law stopping us, we’ll fight it—because bangalore seriously needs better options.

let’s try to fix this traffic mess together!",PseudoTopic_0
reddit,"too many orders before i proceed to rant, i want to say i’m not good at my finances. i got a job an year back and have been enjoying my financial freedom ever since. at this point i’m able to buy things that i’ve always wanted, even the things i didn’t have when i was a kid, like a nerf gun, and a cool rc car. i bought them out of pure childishness, it made my inner child really happy. but lately i have ordered too many adult products as well(not what you think) like bed sheets, curtains ,an electric rice cooker and other things i can’t keep track of. 

i just received a message saying “if you don’t update the location we will return the order (link)”. i know it’s a scam but for 10 min i just scrolled past 5 products in orders list. i’m not able to keep track of my packages and every time a delivery guy passes me while i’m leaving work, i go back to check if it’s mine and disappointed when it’s not. has anyone been in this situation ever ?",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"why are we so entitled and uncivil? - mega rant so just now, i am in my car at a signal waiting to make a legal u-turn. there are other cars and autos behind me waiting to do the same. there is a divider to my right next to me with tall shrubs planted. it’s one of those intersections where on green, the opposite traffic flows, and i have to make the u-turn when i see a break in the oncoming traffic which flows at quite a speed.  at appropriate time, i make the u-turn only to collide with a two-wheeler which is driving on the wrong side and that too almost hugging the divider on their side. no one’s hurt, nothing serious, a fender-bender. 

tamasha time. 

these two guys right away get down from their bike and start abusing me. i try to pull to the side so that we can resolve the matter and also the traffic behind me and the oncoming traffic can make way. they block me. so now my car is half-turned, sideways occupying more road than necessary. soon crowd gathers. there’s honking, cars, autos going around, chaos. the signal changes, so the traffic from the other side charges in, only to be stranded in the middle of the intersection.  even though i am shit scared for my life, i get down and consciously being polite, i ask them to move our vehicles to the side, but no go. i understand, by being aggressive to pre-empt me pointing out that they are literally on the wrong side of the road and that they’re at fault. don’t need to go into more details, as we have seen these incidences. a tall hefty shopkeeper, who must have witnessed the whole thing, comes to my rescue. he starts off with maa-behen gaalis to those guys, goes 2-inches close to their faces and i am thinking he is going to thrash them.  they back down and leave. 

what happened here? a law abiding citizen, following traffic rules came close to getting extorted for money or worse get beat up for absolutely no fault of theirs. i am not naive, i could understand them extorting money if i was at fault. what shook me up is them being riding illegally on the wrong side and still had the audacity and balls to publicly take an offensive stance. you need 8 pair of eyes to drive in india. because it is yours and yours alone responsibility to not only safeguard yourself and your vehicle but also save other people’s lives, their vehicles, their emotions, their pride, their misplaced self-importance and attitude.  
  
before anyone says “india is not for beginners”, i am born and brought up in mumbai. yes, i made a mistake of going abroad to study and work for a decade. and then made another mistake of coming back. i can honestly say, all the civic sense, common courtesy and collective responsibility (especially on the roads and public places) that i have learned, i have learned abroad. i should be punished for following that in my own country.  
  
after i migrated back, i would show indicator for every small turn. a childhood friend mocked me “oh you are so american now! nobody looks at indicator here!”, i told him, “i have learned few good things abroad and i will keep following them” i was laughed at. so we also have this mentality of not only will i not follow rules and regulations but also put others down who do follow.  
  
who taught everyone to drive in the middle of the road and then have this attitude of “you go to your left if you want to avoid collision. i will drive in the middle!” it would be funny if it was not dangerous. i call it raja complex. this is generational trauma of everyone wanting to be the raja and but remained praja.  


if i have a meeting at say 11:00 a.m., i will reach there by 10:55. of course nobody else is there on time.  and this happens every time. so much so that one time, the person setting up the meeting said that i reach there on time and have to wait, so he called everyone else half-an-hour early. so say 11 for me and 10:30 for everyone else. i reach there at 11 and still nobody is there. once they trudge in, they jokingly suggest that i am a lukkha and have nothing else to do so i am always on time. this is systemic folks. arriving late at the meeting is seen as a power play. i literally feel like crying while laughing. no you are not he powerful person here, you are just a vendor, and should be thanking me.  
  
during covid, children in our housing society would play in our open parking compound in the evenings.  my wife and i would go for mini strolls downstairs at times. and i see football getting bounced off cars, including ours. kids are putting badminton rackets, water-bottles on it, they are leaning on it. not just our car but 3-4 cars. so i request them to not use car as a table. i even lugged down a folding table for them to use but no, they kept at it. eventually and as expected, side mirror got damaged. so i complain to the chairman and secretary of the society. and because they have been living in the society for many years before us, they think they own the society and how can the kids not play in their society? okay, at least tell them not to damage other people’s property. no, no one else is complaining, why are you? blah blah. i gave up.  
  
this is not just about cars, recently did renovations of a flat and employed a contractor, got bedroom doors made through is carpenters amongst other things. one door is noticeably tedha. i can see it is leaning on one side, the contractor refuses to accept it. there are 10-12 workers in there, i ask them to tell me its not tedha, they all look at me like i am stupid, like they’ll go against the contractor who gets them work. so i ask them for a leveller. they bring this concoction of a thread and some water thing and says, the door frame is tedha. boss, you only made the door frame. oh shit, he realises, measures again and with straight face tells me the flooring is uneven. him and his workers sate at me straight face, like i am a ch\*\*ya. if i ask the builder, he will say the earth soil is tedha. this was one such instance amongst several for the whole flat. the guy never miscalculated or did anything except perfection as per him. never accepted any mistake (there were several glaring ones). it is draining, exhausting and one gives up after a while.

last week went to buy some chocobar at a local kirana store. his guy picked out the bars. i check them and almost all are broken inside. so i tell the owner that they should not accept such broken ones from their supplier. legit he takes a bar, over the plastic he brings the two broken pieces inside and joins them, “keep it in the freezer for half an hour, it will become one piece” he tells me. but that’s not the point, i am paying you full price of a chocobar that is supposed to be a one single bar. i walked out.

and it is not just uneducated or illeterates, but also educated and well off people. few years back, we were taking a train back to mumbai from a small town in the north. since it was a last minute thing, my mil drove us to the station. we are at the ticket counter in men’s line, my wife is in women’s, whoever gets their first. my mil comes after parking the car, straight away jumps the women’s queue and buys the tickets in 3 minutes flat. my wife and i are embarrassed, my wife is scolding her mother. that is all well and good, but the astonishing thing was, nobody, not a single person objected. yes, i am sure some of it was because it was a woman, but none of the 10-12 women in the queue said anything. basically, when it comes to us individuals or our families, if needed we all will take advantage of others because “once in while it’s okay yaar!”

i was seeing off a friend. he got on the 2-wheeler, his 6-year old son on pillion. i was telling him, exit the gate, go left, make a u-turn and then go straight. well he saw there is another cut towards his direction, but for that he will have to go small distance on the wrong side (similar to two guys on the bike from the beginning). i told him there’s usually a policewala at the corner. he laughed it off saying, if he catches me, 100 rupees is all i need to get away. now, his 6-year old son has subconsciously learned that not only it is okay to break a rule, but if caught, it is okay to bribe as well. he went wrong side just to avoid going around a bit.

people cross streets like they are strolling in a park. they legit don't look sideways.  it is everyone else’s responsibility to make sure they are not harmed/ 

i know we all have all gone through struggles like these, but it’s been 11 years since coming back from abroad and in that period i find we are becoming worse. this post is not about how west is better than us etc. this is not political either. increasingly, there’s absolutely no accountability, no regard, or fear or respect for rules, regulations, laws. no fear of repercussions, it seems like there is bitterness in people that’s just wants to scam or punish others. i don’t know. it is sad actually because we will never change. 

now i understand why we can’t produce global products, why it is so dificult for indian companies to become big globally. it is exhausting to get anything done correctly.  

that’s it. end of the rant. thanks for reading.

reddit,"the “ultimate” dosa trek. first and foremost, thank you to everyone who suggested places. i obviously couldn’t hit every one of them, for logistical and health reasons. but i did end up trying a decent spectrum of dosas.

one thing we learnt was that sunday is great from a traffic perspective but it is not ideal from a dosa perspective as everyone and their grandmas hit the dosa places all over town. so, the crowds are quite insane.

how i chose the places to eat at?

* places that we could get to without too much of a problem
* places near where i was staying – i moved between 3 areas of bangalore (hebbal, whitefield and indranagar)
* places i had not tried before and reddit recommendations

some places i couldn’t visit and regret:

* ctr: the crowds were just insane on a sunday morning

&amp;#x200b;

* sidappa: again, the crowds
* veena stores: annoying kannadiga uncle crowd. they were properly rude to us after cutting in line and then mouthing off at us in kannada.
* aruki kitchen (appears to be u/nahaamajai ‘s place): went there at 4:30pm on a thursday and was closed. [https://imgur.com/rvbdelh](https://imgur.com/rvbdelh)

the first dosa i had was right off the plane. to the right of arrivals, past the parking is a place called nandi upahar and the last dosa i had was 10 days later on the morning before i flew at a random place called udupi hub in whitefield. the most i did was 5 dosas on sunday.

how i ranked them?

* quality of the batter in terms of taste, crispiness/texture
* masala
* condiments: chutney/sambar (some places only provide chutney, others do both. so one combined rating)

so, without further ado, here are the rankings from this “trek”.

**10.** **janardhan hotel:** used to eat here many many years ago and since we were at racecourse road, we said why not. and what a disappointment. a shadow of what it once was

batter: looked bad. a weird ugly shade of brown. a bit on the sour side in taste. and no variation in texture. had an even thickness to it. 4/10

masala: small in quantity. and very bland in taste. just no. 2/10

condiments: sambar was decent – inoffensive. chutney was the white kind. not a bad taste but quite one-dimensional. just coconut with a hint of heat. nothing else. 4/10

&amp;#x200b;

**9. nandi upahar:** i landed early in the morning and immediately walked over to nandi upahar. it is to the right of arrivals, past the parking. anywhere else in the city, this is a slightly below average dosa. but being near the airport, means it is surprisingly good. food at the airport tends to be bad in general. 

batter: just a decent batter all around 6/10

masala: quite bland but did the job. no stand out flavours. 4/10

condiments: chutney was decently spicy. sambar was the typical sambar with a slightly sweet finish. 5/10

&amp;#x200b;

**8.** **udupi food hub:** wanted to grab one last dosa before i headed out to the airport. this place had good reviews and was nearby. so decided to pop over for a dosa.

batter: surprisingly decent. good crispiness and flavour. enough thicker bits that keep the texture interesting. 7/10

masala: another onion and potato masala. have had far better on this trip but this was inoffensive and not too bad. 5/10

condiments: a decent spicy sambar followed by a slightly watery green coconut chutney. the chutney was quite potent here – seemed to have a heavy garlic aftertaste along with some lingering spiciness. 6/10

&amp;#x200b;

&amp;#x200b;

**7. idc:** first time here. they like to put a podi on their masala. while it is a nice mix in textures, i hardly believe it works very well in terms of taste.

batter: not the best looking dosa. but has an even browning. not much variation in thickness and textures. 6.5/10

masala: the podi in the masala didn’t work for me but my cousin brother loved it. the masala itself is quite good. 7/10

condiments: not a huge fan of their sambar or their chutney. they both feel watered down in terms of flavours. nothing bold going on here. 5/10

&amp;#x200b;

**6. mulbagal dosa corner:** we decided to head to mulbagal and do the trek up to avani betta. the trek is a good 2 hours and is very relaxing with great views. after that we drove to mdc on the highway for lunch. the women in the group did not want to eat at the original and hardcore ones right in mulbagal town.

batter: now this was a unique dosa. like an appam and benne dosa had a bastard child. super thin and crisp edges. a crispy outside with a pillowy inside. super interesting textures as well. 9/10

masala: the podi and the masala worked better here. masala was sweet and spicy with lots of podi strewn over it. 7.5/10

condiments: the coconut chutney was the most basic of chutneys. tasted odd and generally quite bland in terms of spiciness. this is something you can expect to find at a north indian place not a south indian place. the red chutney was super spicy but did not really go that well with the dosa as a whole. 3.5/10

&amp;#x200b;

**5. rameshwaram café:** i really don’t get the hate for this place. yes, it is drenched in ghee. yes, it is over hyped. but in there, there are decent flavours. is it the best? no way. is it good? actually it is. we had this picked up and ate at home since the crowd was quite bad and home was just 5 minutes away.

batter: crispy with a slight overcooked feeling to it. drenched in ghee. the soft bits were quite delicious. a bit thin and crumbly in parts 7/10

masala: good flavours. nothing outstanding but above average. 6/10

condiments: sambar was quite decent. finish wasn’t too sweet. which is good. 2 types of chutneys, both are quite good and very similar in taste to each other, although one is a bit more minty. 7/10

&amp;#x200b;

&amp;#x200b;

**4. umesh dosa point/refreshments:** please note umesh dosa point has moved one street away and is now called umesh refreshments.

batter: another good looking dosa. had crunchy and soft bits so was a great textural adventure. tasted really good as well. 8/10

masala: oniony and mixed with a red chutney that had a nice garlicky kick to it. very enjoyable. am loving these oniony masalas btw. 8/10

condiments: the weak link here. while it was good. it didn’t match up to the rest of the dosa. felt like it was getting overpowered by everything else happening on the dosa. maybe that is a good thing for some but it didn’t work very well for me. 6/10

&amp;#x200b;

**3.** **#19 gully foods:** found this in bharatiya city. cousin swore by it. ordered the devenegere benne dosa. the amount of butter that goes in to one of these is bonkers. 

batter: soft on the inside, crispy on the outside. drenched in butter but so moreish, i couldn’t stop eating it on its own. 8/10

masala: looks bland but had quite a kick - really quite spicy. went well with the butter drenched dosa. 8/10

chutney: spicy with a killer kick to finish. perfect for such a thick and rich dosa. sambar was good. a bit watery but the chutney was the star here. 8.5/10

&amp;#x200b;

**2. bangalore thindies:** the other surprise in this list. i didn’t expect much since this was the 5th dosa of the day and i was getting dosa’d out.

batter: yes, another one of those textural wonders. thin and thick all in one dosa. a very nice tasting batter. 8.5/10

masala: very good. a bit more watery than i like but very good flavour – loved the stronger curry leaf flavour along with the chillies in it. 9/10

condiments: a good thick chutney that struck a very good balance between spicy, minty and coconuttiness. 8/10

**and the winner is.....**

**1. by2coffee:** after looking at the crowds at ctr, i remembered the wise words of u/necessarysilver. and boy was he right. this right here could be the hidden gem of dosas.

batter: great tasting. lovely mix of crisp and soft. love the spongy soft parts with huge holes in them – they were great for scooping up extra chutney. the dosa was a beautiful golden brown and looked like it belonged in an ad. 9/10

masala: lovely. with onions that provided a bit of sweetness to it. super flavourful. 8.5/10

chutney: one of the better chutneys i have eaten. spicy but with balance. the coconut flavour was not subdued here. just such a clean and balanced taste. 8.5/10

reddit,"dilemma of purchasing independent house properties in bangalore i am a 30-year-old individual, going to get married in next year. my current ctc is \~50l, thus take home about 36l (did approx.)

i stay in a gated society paying a rent of 35k currently and plan to stay in gated societies only because of the security, crowd and amenities. and the idea of purchasing flat in a society seem to be a money drain in long term as so much water problem etc. and no one would buy a flat after 15 years (if we think in that direction).

so, now coming to other home option i have is to buy independent bungalows (or houses) which is costing me somewhere around 2.5-3cr.(i have some family wealth, and some loan and some my savings, so let's skip the financial aspect of purchasing).(also, lets skip the risk of buying independent, as that also i will get covered from lawyers)

thus, does it make sense for me to buy an independent house when i don't plan to stay in it in near future also, as gated societies would be where i would be spending at least next 15-20 years of my life.

i am asking this question is because of the psychological pressure of not having a home and staying in a rented home 10 years down the line when i will be having a family and kid(s).i am really confused, as one part of mind says if you don't have to stay in the independent house then why to buy it, you can always invest that amount and get crazy returns. then the other part of mind gets scared thinking of a life in bangalore in later stage of life living in rented home with no real physical asset of mine.

so, looking some help here friends, both in terms of finance and psychology if you can share your viewpoint. open to any discussion, if you give proper reason for purchasing society apartment even that i would be open to.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"hrbr kia showroom footpath encroachment i don't fucking get this city. 
this footpath was under construction for almost 6 months and everyone was forced to walk on the street and the issue with that is that this part of the service road has really fast traffic.

now that they've spent so much money on the footpatha, the kia showroom has very conveniently started parking their cars on the footpath. 
is this why the city spent crores and thousands of hours building the footpath?

i can't even lodge a complaint on their app because the bbmp/gba is notorious for leaking the complainant's details.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"my suggestion to fix water problem lately, i've been seeing posts on water crisis asking for suggestions and solutions. i've some background in utilities management but not an expert. instead of posting as comment, i thought i better post this.

fact: bengaluru is lucky in the sense that it receives enough rainfall to supply 70% of its water demand yearly. so, the solution is fairly simple: aggressive rain water harvesting (rwh). i know this is already mandatory for big  societies to implement rain water harvesting but to what extent and capacity it's done, i'm not sure. so if you are in one, please check.

we have lost many lakes in last decade to development, but we can control the damage by building thousands ""micro-lakes"" in every society. this can be done by every society and we don't have to wait for government to fix and revive the lakes for us.

to demonstrate the feasibility, here's an example for a society 1000 apartment, 10 acres. 80% open space, far of \~ 3.5. 

catchment area of society: 45000 m2.

yearly rainwater harvested: \~41000 cubic meter. (900 mm rainfall)

the water required for dry season 3 months: (1000 x 165) x 90 = 14500 cubic meter.

max sump tank volume required: \~ 50 x 30 x 10 m. cost of building including labor: 5-7 cr. this can be below the lowest parking level, away from the building foundation. this is almost 3 olympic sized swimming pools stacked. this will be the micro-lake for the society.

during wet seasons, divert sump overflow to recharge the borewells.  the key is to not let water run-off outside the society. it will be wasted in severs.

cost per apartment: 50-70k  which is less than 1-2 months of the rent and can be offset by reduced water bill in 3-4 years.

following decisions can be taken by rwa's:

1. install water meters even for internal use to discourage water wastage. 

2. install dual drains for clear water runoff and soapy water run-off. the treatment and reuse of clear water is very easy and requires very less energy.

3. aggressively reuse water. the water treatment plants should be maintained well.

4. don't shut swimming pools during dry season, instead maintain the filteration system well. the water replacement is not needed for a long time. during summers, people can use swimming pool and then have bath using bucket at home and they won't crib about water rationing. everyone happy. 

the above things can be done by a society without any help from government. the societies should act like model village panchayats and they have the advantage that they can fund themselves for these kind of things. they can become examples which other rwa's can follow. the added benefits will be lesser flooding in the city and availability of soft and clean water for the residents. very less dependence on tankers which is a waste of energy also. government can give a token subsidy to earn some browny points and take credit for this if they want.

what you can do:

if you are a 

potential buyer: ask for rwh system availability and capacity for the flat you are buying.

owner: push your rwa to make this happen. it will increase your property value and reduce your maintenance bill.

tenant: ask your owner the same thing. don't prefer societies which rely heavily on tankers.

&amp;#x200b;

assumptions made: 67 lpd per capita of water consumption.  national rural average demand is 55lpd and urban is 125lpd, but this deficit can be offset by recycling water.

average number of people in an apartment: 3

 please correct me if am wrong in some calculations by a big margin and suggest other things.

tldr: aggressive and effective rainwater harvesting is enough for this city because we receive good rainfall. every society can become 70% self sufficient in terms of water supply. it can be done because it's in our hands and we don't need to wait for the government. eventually water table will increase and sustain, rest 20-30% of city's demand can be comfortably fulfilled by cauvery.

reddit,"i hate hate hatee this country, india and my life here i hate this country. i hate that i was born here in india. being born here feels like a curse, at least for me. so, for starters, i’m a 16 yr old transgender boy, born and raised in india. i have several valid reasons for absolutely despising this country from the very core of my soul. let’s begin with the people, yep, the very proud *citizens* of india. you all know how insanely diverse this country is, right? every state is like its own little country with different cultural practices, languages, shows, etc. but here’s a list of reasons why i think this country is a failure (there are *way* more, but these ones rlly piss me off):

1. **extreme pride**: so many indians, both online and in real life, have this *ridiculous* inflated sense of pride. they believe india is superior to every other country and that it’s the absolute best. in reality? it’s not lol. they’re just too delusional to see it.

2. **racism**: yep, racism. indians are some of the most racist people, *especially* towards fellow indians. if you’re dark skinned indian, other indians won’t hesitate to throw disgusting, racist comments at you. 

3. **caste system**: can we talk about how messed up it is that we *still* have a caste system? like, in 2025? seriously?

4. **lack of civic sense**: indians, as a whole, lack *basic* civic sense. and no, you can’t just blame illiteracy because even well-educated, wealthy people throw trash in the streets like it’s their personal garbage bin. they’re out here littering the country and then turning around to say how “beautiful” and “better than other countries” it is. the irony is painful to say the least.

5. **judgemental society**: everyone's got an opinion about you and they will make sure you hear it. whether it's your clothes, career choices, gender, or who you love, you're *constantly* judged, scrutinized and looked down upon. privacy is a complete joke here.

6. **corruption everywhere**: bribery and corruption are so normal here, it's practically part of daily life. need basic services? better know someone or be ready to pay off some official. the system isn’t broken, it literally functions like this.

7. **glorifying suffering**: struggles are romanticized here. instead of fixing problems, people flex how much *pain* they’ve tolerated. it’s always “we survived worse” instead of “we deserve better.” it’s toxic asl.

8. **education system:** don’t even get me started on the education system. it kills creativity, mental health, and individuality. it’s just rote learning, unrealistic expectations, toxic competition and zero space for personal growth. nobody gives a damn about what you actually want to do. there ain't much scope for careers like architecture, art, etc. it's always either engineer, doctor or lawyer.

9. **queerphobia/transphobia**: being queer or trans in india is like asking to be treated like trash. people stare, mock, misgender, harass, and dehumanize you for simply existing. it's not just strangers, sometimes it's your own family, school, teachers, doctors. support is rare and safe spaces? almost nonexistent in this country. 

10. **toxic conservatism**: this country is too obsessed with clinging to outdated traditions and moral policing. people here act like personal freedom is a threat to society. wear what you want? you're “asking for it.” speak up? “you're too westernized.” think differently? “disrespectful.”

11. **indians are the biggest hypocrites**: indians l.o.v.e. preaching “respect,” “tradition,” and “values” but where is that energy when women are getting harassed in broad daylight every other day? when people are abused for their caste or identity? it's all fake, performative morality.

12. **forced patriotism**: you can’t criticize the country without being called “anti national.” like sorry bro, wanting a country to be better isn’t hating it, it’s expecting *basic* humanity. but people here just don’t get that. they’d rather live in denial than face the truth.

13. **neglected mental health**: mental health is either ignored or mocked in india. there aren't enough therapists, especially queer affirming ones. public hospitals barely have mental health professionals and private help is expensive. plus, families often dismiss it as “drama” or “attention seeking.” you're left to fight your mind alone. that's another reason why depression and suicide rates in india are rising rapidly.

anyway, i'm done for now. there are a lot more issues i cannot mention in this post. these were just a few i've observed and personally experienced in my 16 years of living here.

edit: 
here are 12 more issues i've seen because some of y'all just won't sthu and accept how flawed your country really is. someone needs to speak up. :

14. **poverty ignored**: india loves showing off its billionaires and skyscrapers, but what about the millions living in slums, without any clean water or food? poverty here isn’t just a “developing country issue” it’s a systemic failure that both, the government and society conveniently ignore.

15. **rape culture**: the number of rape cases reported in india is jst horrifying and that’s *just* the reported ones. victim blaming is so common, police often refuse to file complaints and rapists walk free while survivors are shamed and silenced.

16. **fake democracy**: india claims to be the “largest democracy,” but in reality? voices are silenced, dissent is criminalized, journalists are jailed and elections are full of manipulation. it’s a democracy in *name only*. 

17. **religious extremism**: religion has become a political weapon in india. hate crimes, riots and lynchings happen in the name of faith. if you don’t belong to the majority religion, you’re automatically “less indian” in many people’s eyes.

18. **patriarchy everywhere**: this society still treats women like shit, 2nd class citizens. from birth, girls are told to stay quiet, sacrifice their dreams, and prioritize everyone else. feminism is mocked and asking for equal rights is treated like a threat still. female infanticide still exists in several parts of india. 

19. **lack of accessibility**: india is extremely unfriendly to disabled people. public spaces rarely have ramps, accessible transport is almost non existent and inclusive education is a joke. it’s like people with disabilities are invisible here.

20. **fake progress**: this country loves to brag about development but it’s mostly jst surface level. a few metro cities might look shiny, but rural areas still lack basic healthcare, clean drinking water and decent roads. 

21. **toxic nationalism in schools**: kids are brainwashed from a very young age to blindly worship the country. there’s zero room for questioning history, policies or even basic facts. you’re taught to obey, not to think.

22. **zero work-life balance**: the culture here is so toxic. people are expected to overwork, underpaid jobs are normalized and taking care of your mental health is seen as laziness like i mentioned earlier. rest is treated like a luxury, not a necessity.

23. **no legal protection for queer relationships**: queer people still can’t legally marry, adopt, or even access basic relationship rights. the government refuses to recognize lgbtqia+ people as equal citizens because we “don’t align with indian culture.”

24. **brain drain**: talented people keep leaving india. why? because the environment here is so hostile to creativity, to freedom, to ambition. if you're smart and different, this country will try to shut you down. 

25. **no sex education**: there’s zero proper sex ed in most schools. as a result, kids grow up clueless about consent, safety, and bodies leading to abuse, unplanned pregnancies, and shame. it’s a public health crisis no one wants to fix. that’s also a huge reason why india has such an overwhelming and unmanageable population because people aren’t taught how not to contribute to it.

**anyway, i’m done fr now. the so-called ""indians"" in the comments are doing a flawless job proving every single point i made. it’s honestly just embarrassing and disgusting at this point lmao.**

*edit 2* : to those saying i should just leave india, i definitely will. i’ve wanted to for a long time. but it won’t be an escape, it’ll be a choice. like anyone else, i just want to live a good life. i know i deserve better regardless of what other ppl have to say. if i can feel welcome and find love, freedom, safety, and acceptance in another country, things my birth country never gave me, then i’ll leave without hesitation.

*edit 3* : and to those saying my post was written by ai, i appreciate the accidental compliment lol. i guess my writing’s finally leveling up!",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"whom to contact if garbage marshal acts like garbage ? i have raised several complaints about the garbage situation in my area, but it seems the marshal is not taking the issue seriously and is closing the cases without resolving them. i’m not sure whom to contact next as there is no clear way to reach higher officials. it’s extremely frustrating to feel helpless, especially when basic responsibilities that officials are paid to handle are being neglected.

it’s disheartening to see attention being given to large projects while essential civic issues remain unresolved. why is there no accountability? how did we end up in a situation where citizens have to struggle so much just to get basic services?",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"did the new hebbal flyover really solve the traffic problem? i've been a daily commuter through hebbal since past 5 years so i know the recent traffic trends , if it's a weekend i'll breeze through this junction easily but if you want to see the ""worst of worst "" traffic come here on any monday at 10am sharp. you'll witness why people are crying about bangalore traffic, the epitome of traffic . it takes 30-45 mins to pass this . coming to the topic of new flyover ( from nagawara to mekhri circle ) . as our ips anucheth said in one of the nikhil kamat's podcast  ""flyover won't solve the traffic rather it shifts from one place to another"" , this is a live example. a new stretch of traffic is born from baptist hospital till cbi (gangenahalli). the flyover traffic is still in existence, as you can see in the picture . so, i don't feel like the new flyover solved the problem it just motivated more traffic to move . rather they should've avoided the traffic movement in these area all together but some guy gave permission to the largest mall in bangalore to exist on this road , corruption in the system or system in corruption , idk . 

tl;dr : no, it didn't. more traffic

reddit,"are there any immediate consequences or charges made by police for trespassing in someones property as a mob, intimidation etc? i read in a facebook post where:

1) a bunch of people(residents) targeted a small family by falsely claiming they have built their property compound on road.

2) barged into the property of this family with about 60 people.

3) the distressed family pleaded them to go settle the matter with bbmp(even though the compound was already inspected by bbmp and confirmed it was not built on the road).

4) after pleading them to go to bbmp, the family tried to close the house door and the mob pushed back the door and started taking pictures and saying the family will be ridiculed on facebook and other social media.

5) an elderly was said to be so concerned and anxious of her family that she was trembling and had to be calmed down in another room.

i think if the family complains(which i'm sure they will), the police will just give a warning to these unruly people?",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"lack of dustbins on streets i have just moved to bangalore from bombay. first off, what amazing weather have i landed into. for a humid seaside dweller, this is vacation weather. 
getting to the topic. we are residing in rmv extension which looks like a nice, well maintained locality with wide roads, wide footpaths and lots of trees. we take our dogs out for a walk daily, and we pickup after them. but there are absolutely no bins! i have walked up and down 80 ft road, into the parallel lanes but nothing at all. there is dog poop everywhere as other folks don’t pickup. it is so disheartening considering the neighbourhood has well to do, highly educated folks, lots of doctors (rammaiah hospital), lawyers and ias officers residing. 
for now, we pickup after our dogs and leave the bag along side piled up leaves under a tree, which generally get taken away by the cleaning staff of bbmp. marked bins for different types of waste should be a basic amenity, irrespective of area, but is lacking.
is this a problem across the city or am i just unlucky being in this area?
any ways to address this?",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"how to get the most terrible road in bangalore fixed? i am talking about neeladri road in electronic city phase 1, bangalore. it can definitely compete for the worst road in indian cities. the state govt is congress, the mla is from bjp, electronic city is handled by elcita which does not seem to be interested, the panchayat does not care and bbmp says that this road is out of its boundaries even though it is few meters away from wipro campus.

citizens getting hurt on daily basis with extreme dust, humongous craters, lack of footpath. no one seems to give a damn, mla doesn't give a fuck.

some images https://imgur.com/a/i5mmm

video at night https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d4ekqppeky

bbmp website does not even allow to take a complaint as they say this road falls out of their perimeter.

reddit,"dividing water bills in apartment complexes live in an apartment complex in south bangalore - about 150 flats.
as with everywhere else, the water problem has hit hard. we have never had to buy tanker water and halve relied on borewells and cauvery.

now it's at almost 15 tankers a day. 

the association did not bother to notify residents on the number of tankers coming in and the bills have been piling up. 

we suddenly get a notice that each flat, irrespective of number of occupants or size of the flat, will have to shell out approx 3k a month. 

it's an old apartment so it seems they can't do invididual metres. how are other apartment complexes dividing water bills?",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"got scammed by ecombooks selling pirated books on amazon bought what i thought was a real copy of ""understanding deep learning"" from ecombooks on amazon. turns out they're selling photocopied fakes, every page literally has ""draft"" written at the bottom.

the book i got was complete garbage - print quality looked like a bad photocopy, figures were supposed to be in color and it was obviously fake. these guys are charging almost full price for stolen content.

what really gets me is how common this is. search any popular textbook on amazon india and you'll find tons of sellers doing this same shit. they call them ""economy editions"" or ""low cost editions"" but it's just piracy with extra steps.

this sucks for everyone:

* authors get nothing for their work
* we get crappy books that might have missing pages
* real bookstores can't compete with thieves
* students waste money on useless copies

**good news:** amazon customer service was actually amazing. they approved my refund right away, no hassle at all (still processing but should be done in 24 hours). the support person was really helpful and said they'd investigate the seller. honestly, 10/10 for their customer service team.

but amazon really needs to fix this seller problem. these pirates aren't even hiding - they're right there selling fake books openly.

**warning to everyone:** stay away from ecombooks. if you see books way cheaper than usual or labeled as ""draft copy"" - it's probably fake. check seller reviews before buying anything.

pls report these sellers when you find them. it's the only way to stop this nonsense.

**tl;dr:** ecombooks sold me a fake book on amazon. refund approved immediately by amazon support (processing now), but these pirated book sellers are everywhere on the platform. don't buy from ecombooks or any seller offering suspiciously cheap.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"is india moving towards a one-party system? the recent elections in delhi, haryana, and maharashtra delivered a strong message: the bjp is becoming more and more dominant, while regional parties are collapsing. india's political environment is drastically shifting due to an aggressive central administration, leadership problems within regional parties, and a divided opposition. however, does this indicate stability or the gradual death of multi-party democracy? india has been growing as a diversified federal democracy for many years, and regional parties have been essential in addressing local concerns. but these parties are being politically crushed or dissolved today.

**is there an intentional strategy to destroy opposing forces in an organized manner, or is this just the way politics work?**

# a closer look at bjp's expanding grip:

**1) maharashtra**: bjp manipulated the split of both shiv sena and ncp, destroying its rivals from within; eknath shinde and ajit pawar, once bjp opponents, are now bjp allies, raising the question: is bjp winning elections or absorbing its opposition?

**2) haryana:** once a battleground for regional giants like inld and jjp, the state is now firmly under bjp’s control; jjp, a key player in 2019, has been reduced to irrelevance, while congress is still in ruins; the opposition in haryana is not just weak, but is being rendered obsolete.

**3) delhi:** after ten years in power, the aap government was subject to constant legal, political, and administrative attacks. kejriwal and other top aap officials were involved in corruption investigations, so the bjp took advantage of the chaos to weaken the aap's stronghold on the vote. however, was this a systematic defeat or a fair battle?

# does india's opposition seem to be dying?

**1. the bjp's political engineering?** by kidnapping opposition parties' leaders, cutting off their finances, and undermining their influence, the party has mastered the art of separating and weakening them.

**2. a complete guide on power?** the bjp is gradually eliminating rivals rather than defeating them in elections by using defections, judicial cases, and administrative control over state machinery.

**3. destruction by institutions?** there are serious concerns about the fairness of democracy when central agencies (including the ed, cbi, and it) target opposition leaders on a regular basis.

**4. a silent court system and media?** due to an unfair playing field created by conventional media and judicial delays in politically sensitive matters, many critics claim that the bjp has unchecked power.

**what happens when one party gains too much power? if checks and balances are maintained, a strong party does not always imply a threat to democracy. however, the issue remains the same: do such checks and balances still exist in india today?**",PseudoTopic_0

i watched a movie name wolf of wall street it's about a real life person who did many kind of fraud, scam for money etc. unbelievably i got inspired by it. not me i think everyone will get by the way they represented the story and character. anyway it's not about the movie...... 

i used to watch memes and stuff on an app most people are unaware of but that was not all. i got myself in a group of dealing account, currency and many more things gods knows. and as you can imagine a totally online platform i got my ass scammed. i got filled with many feeling but the one i remembered correctly was """" wow """" yeah i know it feel weird after getting your ass scammed you didn't cry but was amazed

but after all this mess my mind was totally on different level than any other 15 year old kid. i got a moto in my mind people are fucking idiots they deserve what's comming for them. after continuously searching for 15 fucking days i got my first target. i used all i got all words i got and convinced him and later snapped everything from him. i was not in guilt but instead i got cold laughs

from then i started living my life in expenses buying everything i need even more than that and killing my own feelings by my own hand that was fun for me and throughout that time i learned 1 one which was very clear to me

____money is not a drug but is like alcohol it makes you more of what you are_____and believe me it got me wild. with me killing my emotion i started destroying peoples life with the way of talk i developed with time which is ""lying""

for example:-
you worked hard on something with love, money,time then i came fucked your mind with my words snapped everything from you and torture you. till you might suicide, well like hell i cared

things gone wild for me the amount of cursing, cries, bad mouthing increased for me till the point i got my ass popular in that group.by that time i already finished every emotions, sympathy i got in me. the only thing left was a lonely cold hearted. 

with time i got my self full. i didn't enjoyed doing dirty stuff but i got addicted to it as it became a part of my life that's not all i also got my friend involved in it. 

but the resolve to leave the past behind was high in my heart. i started socialising in my school and lucky i falled in love with a girl from my class
curly hair around 5.4, introvert type i thought but that was not correct. but i was no longer i got to know that those cursing worked. the things i touched always broked and got in worse condition. 

my secret kept revealing to people i never wanted to show this side of my life worst part of my life. i also got in self realisation about the things i have done before the words :- i will suicide please dont do it, i thought we were brother why are you doing this, please dont do it i eat all my medicine"" started making sense i cut myself from rest of the world. and thought of only one thing

**the comptroller and auditor general  (cag) has transferred officers, including three who were coincidentally  involved with and in charge of two of the twelve key audit reports that  were presented in parliament during the monsoon session.**

**these twelve cag reports revealed corruption and irregularities  in the functioning of several union government ministries and  departments.the audit report revealed corruption in insurance settlement  claims. the report, among other findings, said that lakhs of claims  continued to be made against some who had been shown as ‘deceased’ in  the database.**

**the cag** [**report**](https://thewire.in/government/cag-report-nhai-toll-collection-railway-bharatmala-udan) on highway projects **found huge overrun costs in the dwarka expressway project**.the **report also found irregularities in the award of projects.**

“instances of **irregularities in award of projects** by  implementing agencies were observed in **clear violation of the prescribed  processes of tendering**, viz., **successful bidder not fulfilling tender  condition or bidder selected on the basis of falsified documents, award  of works without there being approved detailed project reports or based  on faulty detailed project report**,” it said.

**apart from these two reports, the ten other cag reports also  highlighted several other irregularities in union government ministries.the cag report** conducted **on 41 randomly selected toll plazas across** the five  southern states **found that in five toll plazas, a total amount of rs  132.05 crore was collected from commuters** in violation of toll plaza  rules.the report **also found that the nhai collected excess toll fees of  rs 22.10 crore from road users** during 2017-2018 to 2020-2021 at the  paranur public-funded toll plaza.

**the cag report** on the financial audit of the accounts of the  union government found that \*\*the ministry of railways had incurred  unsanctioned expenditure.\*\*in the 2021-22 financial year (fy), the ministry had an  **unsanctioned expenditure of rs 23,885.47 crore, encompassing 1,937  cases**. **in fy 2020-21 unsanctioned expenditure of rs 8,127.97 crore was  incurred by indian railways in 2,775 cases.**

the  telegraph conducted an analysis of a 27-page chapter within report 21  called ‘quality of accounts and financial reporting practices’, finding  that it **“shines a light on  accounting shenanigans that will leave any private conglomerate and its  auditors aghast at the sheer audacity of the sharp practices in central  government accounts “a total of 258 footnotes had been included for  disclosing additional information in \[the finance accounts\] for fy  2021-22.**

**apart from these, the telegraph reported that the government underreported some of its liabilities by over rs 21,000 crore.**

these revelation came from **bvr  subrahmanyam, the ceo** of the government think-tank **niti aayog. as a  joint secretary in the prime minister’s office**, this is **arguably the first time a top government official in the  current indian government has admitted publicly** that **the prime minister  and his team had tried from the start to squeeze the states’ finances**, a  concern now repeatedly raised by the states.

**subrahmanyam shared the information while speaking as a panelist at a  seminar on financial reporting in india,** which had been organised last  year by the **non-governmental think-tank the centre for social and  economic progress (csep).**

in **his remarks – another first by a government official – he revealed  how the federal budgets are “covered in layers and layers of attempt to  cover the truth”**. he added that **he was** **“sure you will have a hindenburg  who will open up the \[indian government’s\] accounts if they are  transparent”**.

he meant, **if the accounts were transparent,** **the truth of the  government’s fiscal condition** **would become evident,** similar to how the  adani group’s questionable accounting practices were highlighted by  us-based short seller hindenburg research.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"election commission thinks people are fools. gyanesh kumar does not have any gyaan at all. his press conference did not answer or explain any of the allegations of electoral fraud nor the issues in the voter list. he just gave analogies, excuses, and was busy gaslighting anyone who questions. not a surprise there.

if he had any sense or humility, he would have said, we will look into the issues, some lapses seem to have happened. but instead he asks where is the proof for fake voters 😄, when the data presented is of election commission itself . 

bjp is defending eleciton commission, election commission is busy attacking those who call it's scams. it is clear as day and night that they are both now one organization - thanks to the sanghi stooges who have inflitrated the ranks. 

the audacity and shamelesness with which the eleciton commission has conducted the press conference on a sunday( govt holiday) - the same day as rahul gandhi's first day of the march in bihar, shows one thing - the election commission is not backing down. they know that they will get jailed if bjp goes out of power. hence they will continue their frauds - voter listes, evm's, disqualifications of oppositon leaders in elections, to do the bidding of the bj pary save their own asses. 

this makes people's protests and opposition as the only reliable means to mount pressure on these corrupt institutions, take the power back, and restore sanctity to constitutional bodies. without that, the rights and freedoms of people will go down, while we get taxed tf out of everything for traffic, pothole filled roads, pollution, and unemployment. 

was annoyed to the brim listening to his answers in the press conference. even thought some journalists have asked good questions, i wish some of them countered him saying that his responses dont answer the question, and he is just giving excuses for the lapse in ec's duty to conduct free and fair elections.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"hosa road of south east bangalore is one strong contender for the worst road in city so today i had to visit a place close to the pes university near electronic city, which closes by 7:30pm. we left on scooter at 6:20 from our place near hosa road, total 4.7km distance. simple right?

for the people who don't know, this hosa road is an important link between hosur road to sarjapur road. i don't have data, but there must be at least 50 thosand apartment units (plus all kind of residences) within 1 km of this road.

unfortunately, most of it is pothole ridden throughout the year. you can imagine what happened when there was a small downpour on this friday evening.

despite being on a scooter it took us &gt;45min to cover the first 2km. everyone desperate -- from pedestrians to truck drivers. everyone hopeless. saw a bmw hit a taxi from behind, one activa toppling in a narrow gap b/w a car and a large pothole. this is when we knew that there was no way we could make it by 7:30, and decided to turn back. guess what, another 40 minutes to get back home!

totally 1.5 hrs for 4km. for no reason. spoilt the evening. totally pissed.

i can only imagine what will happen when another 10-15k desperate cars will be added to bangalore roads in the next 2 months, thanks to the gst cuts.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"factors that are making city traffic worse stress of driving is increasing day by day even when you are not driving on busy roads. people are driving on the wrong side of the road to avoid 100 meters of extra driving. as soon as they hit the road, gaming(panic) mode activated. i drive 20 kms daily from work to office and back ( i guess i am blessed). i drive mostly on less congested roads. there was a time when it used to take less than 10 mins one way. nowadays my commute time has increased to 30 mins oneway and it is still not too bad considering what people face everyday. few factors that i feel are contributing to slower traffic on road with lighter traffic: 

1. 10-min delivery drivers: they drive in every direction without looking at their sides. if they think it can save them 2 secs, they would not mind driving over the road dividers. i feel 10 mins delivery companies are creating more traffic stress in people's life than convenience. 

2. shared autos/e-rickshaws: these people are always rushed. they do not like put their feet on the brake pedal. they play gta in real life without caring about the lives of their passenger, pedestrians, two wheelers, and cyclists. they do not hesitate to get into fights and are always stressed and agitated. suppose someday policy decide to take action against us we will go strike.

3. app-based taxis: condition of their cars speaks about the driving skills. they love bumper to bumper driving even on empty roads. when they feel they miss their turn it's time time to stop the car in the middle of the road and turn back. 

4. bike taxis/porters/two wheeler riders: most skilful stunt drivers, they dodge speed breakers, pedestrians on footpaths, always find a way to reach to the front of a traffic signal at the cost of scratching few cars (no problem we are ready to fight). if you speak against us, our mla will come to our rescue as we brought him to power. 

5. police barriers during peak hours: police put barriers to check the traffic offences, catch the criminals or to divert the traffic. the only problem is that they forgot to man the barriers. after putting the barriers they get too tires and goes back to sleep somewhere. 

6. construction materiel on the road: municipal authorities is still thinking about repairing a road  but the contractor knows it so he dumps tons of material on the road and it lies there for months. i have a building material business, i shouldn't be bothered about renting or buying a warehouse to store. i can simply dump on the road and put my chair beside it and the business is ready. 

7. patting zoo for kids: kids enjoy patting animals therefore we have made our road patting zoos. in our zoos, we have cows, goats, sheeps, donkeys, dogs and buffalos. 

8. mob behaviour: we jump red lights in such large numbers that it becomes very difficult for traffic policy to fine us. when one side of the traffic is blocked, we use the other side to ensure it is also blocked. if i am not going you are not going brother, we are all stuck here.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"indigo airline cancellation victim here ama booked my ticket from chennai to delhi. just got the confirmation of cancellation for my almost midnight flight. they have claimed to give full refund within 3-4 business days and are deeply pained by this inconvenience. it is my brother's engagement ceremony tomorrow and the distance is a lot so had to book another flight.

airindia has options but they have removed their listings from yatra. i think all airlines have. only layover flights were listed with the shortest time period of 23 hours.

went to airindia's own website and i can see the listed flights there at 8 times the cost. so my 8.5k indigo flight that got cancelled forced me to buy a 71k airindia flight instead.

glad to see capitalists capitalising as usual and we pay while indigo argues with dgca. same thing happened during chennai floods too where they tripled and quadrupled the prices.

desh main cut toh sabka raha hain, aaj mera cut gaya. 

would request everyone to use the tiny little power we have left and not book any future flights from indigo. ask your company hrs to do the same for corporate flyers. hundreds of cancellations a day just to bully dgca into allowing indigo to not follow their latest rules.",PseudoTopic_0

**note:** rough transcript was taken from youtube, edited heavily by me. transcript is very close to complete, although there may be some minuscule parts which were incoherent and hence not part of it.

### transcript

brothers and sisters, friends and i don't see the children who sang but, where are they, yeah i'd like to welcome all of you and thank all of you for coming here and also thank the wonderful children for the song they sang it was sung very movingly and very well.

some months ago, we started a walk from kanyakumari to kashmir. prior to walking, we were finding that the normal tools that we used to use for politics, conversations like this public meetings was simply not working anymore. all the instruments that we needed to do politics in india - they were controlled by the bjp and the rss. you know people are threatened, this is (important?) people, agencies are used on people. so, we were also finding that in some way it had become quite difficult to act politically and that's why we decided to walk from southernmost tip of india to srinagar. 

when we started, i thought okay. after five or six days, we realized that actually walking four thousand kilometers is not an easy thing you know and and i had an old knee injury that started to act-up. so i said now i’m in real trouble because there's no choice - one has to walk and i'm having quite a lot of pain then quite a surprising thing happened just i started noticing that after walking 25 kilometers - 25 kilometers is more than half a marathon - after walking three weeks every day 25 kilometers i suddenly felt one afternoon that it's strange that i'm not feeling tired at all. i get up in the morning six o'clock - we used to start and we used to end walking at about 7.30-8 in the evening. i was like, this is very strange - i'm not feeling tired at all, what is this? then i started asking people around if they are feeling tired, everybody is saying it's very strange that they're not feeling tired as well. 

so i started to think about it and i realized that actually what was going on was that it was not us who were walking, it was india that was walking with us, right, and the large mass of people who are coming from all religions, all communities, everybody, kids - they were creating an atmosphere of love and affection where nobody was feeling tired. almost as if, everybody was walking together, helping each other, and that's where we came up with the idea - nafrat ke bazaar mein mohabbat ki dukaan kholi (*we opened a shop of love amidst the market of hate*).

[applause]welcome welcome[music][applause][music][applause][music]

[commotion in the back of the conference]

see, the interesting thing about us, about the congress party, is we have affection towards everybody - if someone wants to come, and say something - regardless of what they're saying, we're happy to listen to it. we are not going to get angry, we're not going to get aggressive, we'll nicely listen to it. in fact, we'll be affectionate to them we'll be loving to them because that's our nature.

so, we found that when everybody started walking together - completely different type of energy started coming and i noticed that the government tried everything. [*i mean, they tried all their might in stopping the yatra. they used police - but it didn't work - but the effect of yatra was constantly rising. why it happened was because you all helped us.*] not only in india, bharat jodo is an idea that is in all your hearts. and, it is about respecting each other and being affectionate to each other, it is about being not being violent towards each other, not being arrogant. i can see my sikh brothers here. your guru nanakji - his entire life was about this only. that, be humble, right, be humble, be affectionate and we walked nothing compared to guru nanakji. i read somewhere that guru nanakji had gone all the way to mecca, saudi arabia, he had gone to thailand, he head gone to sri lanka. so, these giants were doing bharat jodo much before we were born, right? and i can say the same for my friends from karnataka - basavanaji, friends from kerala - narayana guruji. 

yeah so every state in india has had these giants everywhere. i mean and every single one of them said listen to each other, be respectful - not just of your own religion, not just of your own language, not just of your own culture - but be respectful towards all cultures, all religions, all languages because they are in fact the same. and, the assault that is taking place in india - it's taking place on our way of life. sam petrodaji said that he grew up with all people living happily - different languages, different religions and that is what is being attacked. also, the tradition in india and again something like gurunanakji, basavanaji, gandhiji emphasized that not to be under the impression that you know everything that the world is too big too complicated for any one person to think that he understands everything and he knows everything. and so really that is the disease that sam outlined that that is the disease that we have a group of people in india who are absolutely convinced that they know everything. in fact i think they think maybe they know even more than god. they could they could sit down with god and have a conversation and explain to him you know about what is going on and of course our prime minister is one such specimen. 

[applause]

i think i think if you if you sat modiji down next to god modiji would start explaining to god how the universe works. and, god would get confused that what have i created. so these are these are funny things but but really this is what is going on we have a group of people you know who understand everything. they can speak to scientists and explain science to them. they can you know speak to historians and explain history to them. they can explain warfare to the army and flying to the air force. whatever they want, they can you know and at the heart of it is mediocrity. that they actually don't understand anything because because in life you cannot understand anything if you are not ready to listen. that's something the biggest - lesson i learned from bharat jodo yatra that there is something to learn from everybody. we are much older than those children but i can guarantee you they can teach us all how to sing. i was looking at them and i was thinking you know i can't sing like that. it's impossible, so when you look at another person, you have to appreciate that they have an experience, they have a life, they have seen things and maybe you can learn a lot from them. maybe if you open your ears, you will listen to them and learn from them. and that is actually the indian tradition. if you look if you look at our country, you will find that our country has the ability to absorb any idea that comes. india has never rejected any idea. everybody who has come to india - has been received with open arms and their ideas have been absorbed in india. and that is the india that we like - india that respects the rest of the world, india that is humble, india that listens, india that is affectionate. 

and that is the india that you represent. you would not be here if you do not if you did not agree with these values. if you if you believed in anger, hatred, arrogance - you'd be sitting in a bjp meeting. and, i would be doing mann ki baat.

[applause]

thank you very much for holding up the indian flag in america. showing the american people, what it means to be indian, respecting them, respecting their culture, learning from them and also allowing them to learn from you. you make us all proud. and, when we think of our country, you're all our ambassadors. when america says indian people are extremely intelligent, indian people or masters of it, indian people are respectful - all these ideas that have come, they've come because of you and because of your actions and your behaviors. so i thank you very much for that.

i came here this morning, sam organized the flight - i arrived after 16 hours of flying - 6.30 in the morning - i thought i'd be tired but i'm not tired at all because of the energy that you have given me. thank you.

[after a break]

they've asked me to answer your questions. see that that also would not happen in a bjp meeting.


**question 1** - so i would like to ask you two questions - regarding this woman bill that has been uh you know in the court for almost more than half a century, so when the congress comes in power - bill about woman's reservation rights - so that bill has been there for more than a quarter century. so as a congress leader,  what are your thoughts on it and how are you gonna deal with it? that's my first question. the second question is - in india, it's very hard for a woman - as a safety issue - so what are we going to you know offer our next generation of the girls in india. thank you.

**rahul gandhi** - so on the women's reservation bill - we are committed to that. we wanted to pass it in the last government but some of our allies were not too happy with it and they didn't give us the support for that bill. but i'm confident when we come to power we'll pass that bill. i think part of the answer to your second question lies in the first question itself. if we empower women, if we involve women in the political system, if we give women space in the governance of the country, if we give women space in the businesses of the country, we will automatically make them safer. so i think involving them in politics, involving them in business, involving them in running the country are the way to give them power. thank you. 

**question 2** - hello rahul ji, my name is pugal. i'm the president of indo-american society for science, reason and free-thought. i also represent tamils who live in bay area. on behalf of our people and on behalf of people who believe in science, reason and free-thought, i would like to point out the we are honored, humbled and most truly, proud of your journey about opening up the shops of love on the streets of hate all over the india. tamils have long tradition of harboring brotherhood mindset throughout their civilization - three thousand years ago our forefathers said

[speaks in tamil]

[applause]

translation - all human beings are created equal and every town is our town, everybody is our relative. 

to us, india is like european union with each state having its own language, its own tradition, its own festivals, its own cuisine, dress code, way of living etc etc. they are all different, yet we live under one country called india therefore it is deeply saddening to us when someone from the union government try to impose one language one culture, one tradition, one religion, one school etc. recognizing this diversity to make a robust country, our beloved leader - the dravidian icon former chief minister proclaimed, both in parliament and in public forums, [speaks in tamil] which means autonomous rule at the state level and federal rule at the union level.

dear rahulji, you have studied in america and you have traveled within united states extensively and you know much better than anyone else in this room that america is the best example of federalism. each state has its own constitution. it's one supreme court apart from federal laws. whereas in india, congress party did have its own share of problems in the past but the times have changed the new thinking has emerged and you are the epitome of the new thinking. you are they new hope and the streets of hate in india - my question to you is that like united states of america what's your thought on making india as a true united states of india. thank you[applause]

**rahul gandhi** - if you read our constitution, the definition of india in the constitution is a union of states and within our constitution is the idea that the languages, cultures, histories of each one of our states has to be protected under the union. so what you're talking about, is already incorporated in our constitution, it's already there. the bjp and the rss are attacking that idea that you mentioned and also the constitution of india. that is fact now. for me personally, i understand that the tamil language is more than a language to tamil people, right? it is not just a language, it is their history, it is their culture, it is their way of life and i will never ever allow tamil language to be threatened. [applause] 

threatening the tamil language is to threaten the idea of india just like threatening bengali or threatening kannada or threatening hindi or threatening punjabi are all attacks on india. so our strength unlike many other countries, our strength comes from our diversity, our strength comes from accepting that we are all different, but we can work together and that is an idea that i'm sure you and the congress party are protecting. thank you. 

**question 3** - hello rahulji, i am ganapathy. we welcome you here. we wholeheartedly thank you for taking up the fight against the fascism. so this rise of fascism is not a mere coincidence - and we believe in the social and the economic equality in the society and the inequality actually creates a conducive environment for fascism to emerge. so my question is like what is the plan of the indian national congress to improve the economic and the social inequality which creates this condition for fascism in the indian subcontinent and also at the global level. 

**rahul gandhi** - one of the things that we are suggesting is when we were in government we had carried out a caste census and the idea behind the caste senses was to take an x-ray of indian society - to find out what are the exact demographics of our country, what are the different communities, what are the different costs, how many people in each community, how many people in each caste, because without understanding our demographics and without understanding who is who, it is very difficult to distribute wealth, distribute power effectively.

so that was one idea that we had and we've been putting pressure on the bjp to release the caste census, the numbers and they are of course not doing it and we'll continue to apply pressure and if we come to power we will do that but we are committed as the congress party to make india a fair place and we understand deeply that india today in terms of its treatment of dalits, tribals, poor people, minorities is not a fair place. and, there are many many things that can be done - there is the nyay scheme that we had which was aimed at providing a minimum income to all indians, there are ideas like mnrega. i think an increase in public education, increase in public health care - i thinkthese are all things that can be done to make india a much more equal and fair place. thank you.


**question 4** - rahulji, now the parliament lok sabha seats are increasing to 888 - what's your take on it? there's a proposal that you know modiji is actually working on-  it is going to be entirely based on population. it is going to tilt you know the orientation towards the highly popular states getting more and more lion share of the revenues and everything - so it's going to change everything you know - minorities are going to get even more depressed, you know majorities are going to be you know making everybody vulnerable - so what's your take on it?

**rahul gandhi** - exactly how they're thinking about doingit - but i think one has to be very very carefully - when one change changes the representative structure of a country. so i'd be quite interested in understanding exactly how they've comeup with the number 800 [sic] and what are the criteria that they're using - these things should not be done flippantly. india is a conversation, india is a negotiation between its languages, between its people, between its histories and cultures and that negotiation has to be fair - meaning all parts of india, all the states of india should feel that there is fairness in the process of negotiation. if i see exactly how they are coming up with 800 and what is the design then i would be able to answer whether i agree with the number 800 but i haven't seen the way they're calculating it [inaudible audio in the background], but it depends how they how the ratios change- yeah it is currently based on the population but you'll have to see how the ratios change. 

i think the parliament house - these are the distractions - the real issues in india are unemployment, price rise, spread of anger and hatred , crumbling education system, price of education, price of health care - these are the real issues. bjp can't really discuss them, so then they have to do the whole skepter thing, you know lying down and doing all that aren't you happy i'm not lying down? thank you.

**question 5** - rahulji, thank you so much for coming all the way here. i think this is something which we were starving for as muslims from the bay area. we all want to thank you for your time and for your efforts in coming all the way here. as you know that you know muslims have the security threat today like it was never before. the way we see today, like whenever we call and talk to anybody, it's like what's going on. there are so many different laws which are getting implemented which were not even implemented earlier - if it is just about the security it's okay, but then if it goes on and they are putting muslim kids in the jails for the crime they have not committed - what strategy will you adopt or what hope are you giving to indian muslims which is going to change the whole thing back to the point where we were and get back to the normal stream to develop india the the best way?

**rahul gandhi** - for me to explain that is the line - nafrat ke bazaar mein mohabbat ki dukaan kholi (*we opened a shop of love amidst the market of hate*) - that is the best way i can say it which is that it is felt most strongly by the muslim community. okay, because it is done most directly to them but in fact it is being done to all minorities - i can guarantee you that the same way you're feeling attacked, i can guarantee you my sikh brothers are feeling the same thing, i can guarantee you my christian brothers are feeling the same, i can guarantee you, the dalit community is feeling the same thing tribal communities feeling the same thing right - in fact anybody who is poor in india today - when he looks at the extreme wealth that a limited number of people have, in some way, he feels the same thing that you feel that what is going on? how is it that these five people have lakhs of crores and i have nothing to eat? so, you feel it most because it is directed at you most aggressively but it is a phenomena that is taking place against everybody in india right and you cannot cut hatred with hatred. it's impossible. you know that. you can only cut hatred with love and affection.

i was surprised at how easy it was to erase hatred in india. i was shocked. i didn't imagine that [speaks in hindi] - *walking from one place to another could make such a great difference.* i didn't imagine it. indian people, as you yourself have said, they don't believe in this stuff, they don't believe in hating each other, they don't believe in killing each other. this is a small group of people who have got control of the system, who've got control of the media and who are fully supported by you know - big money. but this is not the large mass of indian people - i can guarantee you. i walked from kanyakumari to kashmir, i can guarantee you there are more people who believe in love and affection than hatred - millions and millions more.

so, don't be pessimistic. also, i'd like to point out another thing. this happens periodically in india. what is happening for example to the muslim community in india today - happened to the dalit community in the 80s. if you went up to them in the 80s - what is happening with the muslims is what was happening with the dalits. so, periodically, this type of stuff happens and we have to challenge it, we have to fight it and we have to fight it with affection and not fight it with hatred. we will do that. thank you. 

**question 6** - welcome rahul sir and thank you so much for your win in karnataka. you've made a lot of people very very happy. we've literally cried tears of joy - so thank you. my question for you would be that we have a lot of students who helped out here today - we really feel passionately for your cause and which is our cause now but what would you say to us if we want to go back to india - we want to represent our country - but we see how the athletes, the youth, the wrestlers there in recent times are being treated, it's very undignified - we feel very discouraged. so, what would you say to us to kind of bring the sense of wanting to go back out there for our country? 

**rahul gandhi** - please realize that there's a huge distortion - india is not what the media shows - the media likes to show you a particular narrative - it likes to promote a particular narrative that is actually not what is going on in india. it was very clear to me in the yatra that it's in the media's interest to project these things. it helps the bjp. so, don't think that everything you see in the media is the truth and as a young person, your country needs you - your skills and your energy will be very useful to your country. so if you feel like going back, do go back and help out. thank you.

**concluding remarks** - you are all ambassadors of a particular vision of our country - you believe in humility, you believe in respect, you believe in being affectionate to each other - so do not answer with anger and hatred - with love and affection, show them that you are not like them [applause] you should support the ideas that will defeat the bjp. thank you very much.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"why do you guys hate bangladeshis so much? again, i'm not trying to whitewash what's going on in bangladesh right now. i recently saw some rapper from uk from bangladesh in my fyp, it had a dozen comments calling us kanglus, saying how we're bangladeshi; not bengali when bengali is an ethnicity, and then having an issue with the girls attire, trying to even claim the girls in the video were too fair when they actually were pretty in the middle. 

someone on the comment section was also talking about how ""we are ruining british culture"" by bringing in a rikshah for a day, and having a model dance on it which again, isn't necessarily taking away from their culture. another even said ""it's not african american it's either african or american"" again taking jabs at the black population in america (which were brought in through slavery with no choice of their own) to promote white nationalist talking points. i'm not sure what this man said it in response to. i've even heard others promote this notion that we're r-word babies, and just pure garbage. 

personally, i've been into hindu gods and goddesses for a long time. and from my own personal experience, i've had an indian guy tell me that modi is going to take over bangladesh. anyways, i'm not here to spread hatred. all i'm trying to say is that, yes my country's politics is one where people are highly polarized. it's just a consequence of events and as such, there's going to be people choosing india or pakistan and you'll see the manifestation of it. 

but there's also plenty of level-headed individuals that don't want to sabatoge the relationship with india and actually remember our liberation war as a historical symbol of our freedom. i think and i'll say this as a message: if you guys want to fight bangladeshis and pakistanis (them too), please use logic, and spread awareness. this degrading that many of you partake in as if we're sub human (i think nowadays you guys do  it more to bangladeshis because i think pakistanis are deemed attractive), is not right and will radicalize even those that would've heard your case/cause. 

a message to west bengalis: i understand that many of you want to be represented and also feel like you want to saperate from us due to the recent events, but going to people's platforms and commenting bangladeshi; not bengali is not it. because at the end of the day, we're bengali too -that is our ethnicity.

disclaimer: i have nothing to do with the politics/laws or events of my country.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"electric shocks from my laptop electric shocks from my laptop

hey guys, just moved to bengaluru recently for my master's and i'm currently staying at a pg. i was wary going in because of numerous horror stories i've heard about pgs, so i was surprised when everything seemed to be pretty straightforward and decent(pressure on the tap in the bathroom nonwithstanding but i can live with that.)

being in a rush with my university opening recently , i hadn't gotten a chance to use my laptop till today. i used it for a while without charging and then figured i should charge it for a while before i sleep so that i can take it with me the next day.

i plug it in, go to shut the lid of the laptop and... weird... my hand kind of just jumped back, again. this time i realised it was a shock. 

at first i thought it was static, but it was way too strong for that. using a series of very stupid experiments i concluded that i still got shocked even when the switch was off. but as soon as i disconnected the power plug thing from the laptop it was fine(laptop was working flawlessly all this while.) 

what's going on here? this charger was working fine till i moved here, why has it started to spazz out now? or is it something wrong with the power source? any way to fix this? i get the feeling that fighting with the pg guys about this is going to be a bother. 

edit
alright so update everyone along with some more info. pg isn't an old building, was built just two years ago or so. i tried using it again today with the charger plugged in and it was a-okay. i'm guessing this was probably a build up of static electricity or something but for now i'm sorted. thanks for all the replies in the dead of night :)",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"i'll try to summarize what's happening in india and how the aapians are the new bhakts in town so the party came on the back anti corruption crusade lead by the likes of anna hazare, kumar vishwas, kejriwal, kiran bedi etc... well most of these leader have cut contact with this man or are headed otherways.. 
      
    now his so many ministers are in jail like satyendra jain, lamba, vijay singla to name a few cause there are many.. and recently manish sisodia is under scanner where his chances aren't looking good.. now this is main plank of it's genesis and it has left a few regional parties behind in corruption cases.. go figure 
       
    2ndly kejriwal wants a police state, u ask how, well there's a video of him saying that ""bas ek bar police hath me aane do, jo ye ek aadh bolte h inko thikane laga doonga(once let police come into my hands, i will treat these 1,2 people speaking out against me), and he proved it by using punjab police to terrorise kumar vishwas, tejinder bagga who don't reside in punjab, nor were the comments  made there for which they were to be arrested, so the high court of punjab and haryana had to step in.... 
           
     used to say will live like a aam aadmi post becoming cm and won't take big bungalow, well u guessed it, he has done a u- turn here too , well not that m against a cm having any of these facilities but it's more about ur credibility once u come into power, means u will say anything to come into power, more on this 
            
    freebies, they aren't good we all know that, some socio economic welfare schemes are already in place like free health cover upto 5 lacs for poor people, ration at almost free rates, educational concessions, are a few which i can get behind . but both his wins have come on the back of freebies, now if this thing happens in one more state, other political parties will see no other way to survive but to offer more freebies than each other to win elections which i guess shouldn't be the main plank of any political party cause see sri lanka and pakistan's  economic condition
        
    he has literally bought the media, delhi government expenditure on ads was 11,12 crore in 2011-2012 which now stands at 488 crore in 2021,
       
     besides what has he accomplished, besides giving freebies which will come back to bite us in the ass soon enough, for example he touts his education reforms in delhi, dude wat does that even mean, and anyway recently punjab government sent a delegation to delhi to learn about their educational reforms and one two days later it was revealed that punjab's education model was ranked ahead of delhi.. so wats the fuss all about dudes.. free electricity, free bus rides for women.. 
         
 for all it's faults, this other dude was saying kidnapping, loot ,extortion are common in bjp ruled states, well have u guys heard of up being syononomus with gunda raj and now tell me if there hasn't been a day nd night difference there on that plank, giving only up 's example here should suffice cause it was the worst victim of this vector... goes on to say that government has let chinese intrude in our territory and lying to us about it well of all the easiest ways to stay in power is to declare a war as history will tell u so does the bjp not want to be in power, a recent example was the pulwama attack where the aapian and others said that it was staged by bjp to win the upcoming elections as i know u all will remember very well, so yeah y not declare a war cause that's what u have gonna have to do if other nation seizes ur territory, only this tool can beat freebies at times,",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"1 hour for 2 km — zomato guy became traffic police while the real ones vanished only in namma bengaluru! yesterday it took me 1 hour to move 2 km — rain, potholes big enough to host a swimming competition, and zero traffic police in sight.

but amidst the chaos, something heartwarming happened — a zomato delivery guy, already drenched and probably late for his delivery, started managing the traffic along with a few locals. they literally turned into traffic cops, guiding autos, bikes, and cars just to keep things moving.

meanwhile, the government seems busy planting saplings on dividers and painting walls instead of fixing the craters we call roads. 😑

massive respect to the real heroes — the delivery people and common citizens who actually keep this city running. 🙌❤️",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"bangalore's biggest traffic disaster bangalore's largest traffic crisis is yet to present it self. there were definitely opportunities to solve it before it occurred. i am not talking about silk board jn. the long-standing congestion at silk board will see some relief once the flyover on the opposite side opens. even with one side being open, it has solved a large portion  of traffic problems.

i am concerned about what is unfolding just outside the new horizon engineering college on the outer ring road, the road in front of new horizon college gate is planned to be widened in to a 150 foot wide highway and extended all the way to kolar. despite this road being in the works for 20 years, local politicians haven't made meaningful efforts to improve its design at the spot where the road merges in to orr. adding to the problem, the new highway won’t have an underpass where it meets orr, as metro pillars are already in place. in a few years, this area is set to become the world's worst bottleneck, where a 150 foot wide highway will converge into a service road - what a sad outcome !  given that there will be no provision of underpass, entry from the orr on the road will also be difficult and will clog other spots on the orr. 

just imagine all the traffic from whitefield and varthur that will congest this very spot. a few tech parks were initially planned along this route in varthur, but they were canceled after investors withdrew, citing concerns over the future traffic problems at this spot. eventually, developers opted to build residential flats instead, and buyers are eagerly purchasing these properties with the assumption that road will be constructed soon.  is anyone more gullible than flat buyers who believe this road will be completed soon? several sections of the road have already been completed, but private landowners are hindering further progress. the bda is overseeing the construction, yet, surprisingly, both the bbmp and the forest department have raised concerns about land acquisition as well. so the road is disconnected at several locations.  it is proposed that bda will build this road till kolar district under cdp/rmp plan and from there state government will take the road forward to other places.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"bellandur : when city planning meets corruption and incompetence this is the third story in a series of posts which try to uncover the reasons for problems in bellandur's infrastructure. for previous stories visit my profile. 

bellandur, a bustling locality in bengaluru, has been grappling with a severe lack of space and infrastructure. while it's easy to point fingers at city planners for their failure to design adequate road networks, the truth is far more complex. the city planners did lay down an extensive road plan, but corruption and incomeptance  within the system involving builders, landowners, and government officials from the bengaluru development authority (bda) and the bruhat bengaluru mahanagara palike (bbmp) has derailed the urban development of this area. in this blog post, we will delve into one specific instance of this ongoing struggle and how it relates to the city's master plan.

*rmp 2015: a blueprint for development*

in 2007, the bda unveiled the revised master plan (rmp) 2015, a roadmap for bengaluru's urban development. this master plan was intended to guide the city's growth, ensuring a balance between urbanization and the preservation of agricultural land. landowners were given the opportunity to develop their properties into large apartments or tech parks, provided they surrendered land for public roads as stipulated in the rmp-2015. this master plan is accessible to the public on bda and bbmp websites, and it outlines all proposed roads, offering a vision for the city's future.

the corruption conundrum : however, the reality on the ground tells a different story. many developers and landowners have proceeded with construction projects without fulfilling their obligation to allocate land for public roads. the reasons behind this failure are multi-faceted and include pervasive corruption, incompetance, political interference, and  confusion within the system. this chaotic situation is what bellandur finds itself in today.

*a case study: doddakannahalli*

let's consider a specific case in doddakannahalli. the bda officially published rmp-2015 in 2007 and mandated its adherence. in 2017, the bda issued a provisional document for rmp-2031, but this was not enforced. it created an updated plan, raising questions about which one should prevail. in this case, a landowner approached the bda for construction permits. according to rmp-2015, there was a road passing through their property. however, this road did not exist in rmp-2031. despite rmp-2015 being in force and rmp-2031 being provisional, the landowner was granted permission to construct because as per rmp-2031 there was no road. 

*the twist* : in 2021, the government withdrew rmp-2031. in 2022, the landowner completed construction and applied for an occupancy certificate. they were denied the certificate on the grounds that the building encroached on a road according to the master plan, and demolition was demanded.the landowner took the matter to court, arguing that government officials had approved the construction, and denying an occupancy certificate would result in significant financial loss. the blame was shifted to the government.

high *court's verdict* : the court, in both the writ petition and the writ appeal, sided with the landowner. their rationale was that since the government had initially granted approval, an occupancy certificate should be issued. this decision highlights a complex issue within the system, where government officials who are aware of the law and map details still approve projects that may later create problems.

the road's approval was nullified, as the building was granted an occupancy certificate. whether there was confusion regarding the application of rmp-2015 or rmp-2031 is irrelevant. ultimately, bellandur did not receive the planned road and it will not even in the future, and the area is now facing congestion. while people may point fingers at the planners, the real issue in india's urban planning lies with the plan's execution. the bellandur case exemplifies broader problems in urban planning and development, including corruption, inefficiency, and a lack of systemic coordination, leading to unplanned city expansion and insufficient infrastructure. the question remains as to why officials initially approved the building's construction only to later deny it. whether it was a strategic move, corruption, or incompetence remains uncertain. 

  
\* rmp-2031 and rmp-2015 plans can be downloaded from bda/bbmp websites.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"bangalore is a completely different city than we think it is. moved to padmanabhanagar from varthur recently and now i am in complete cultural and societal shock.  i just joined reddit few days ago and this is my very first post - i am originally from haryana. i spent my childhood in gurgaon, pursued my education in mumbai, and completed my master’s and worked in the us. i moved to bangalore four years ago and initially lived in varthur. during that time, i fell in love with a localite who was my colleague. we got married, and six months ago, i moved to his house in padmanabhanagar.

during my stay in varthur, i often felt that bangalore was overrated. although it is marketed as a tech hub, my experience was limited to its proximity to the tech park. the area lacked proper roads, infrastructure, amenities, and—most importantly for me—culture. it felt non-existent. people were rude, disconnected from each other, and the place resembled a lifeless concrete jungle—more like a concrete immigrant asylum.

fast forward to today, i now live in padmanabhanagar, which is probably deep in the heart of bengaluru towards south west. it’s a place where someone like me, a ""north"" techie would least expect to venture, because there is no point living there unless you are a localite, tech parks are far away from that place, but i shifted to complete wfh now.

i was shocked and baffled by this place. the infrastructure is top-notch—though not quite like the us, it is far above the standards of a typical indian city. there are beautiful parks, trees that almost touch the streets, and no water issues, all the footpaths and roads are very well maintained, though there are few potholes here and there (this is probably the de-facto standard of india). it is on par with the posh areas of mumbai that i used to visit during my college days.

more importantly, i want to talk about the people. they are completely different from those in varthur. i initially thought my inability to speak kannada would be a problem here, but guess what—almost everyone knows english, and i didn’t face any issues at all. the south indian culture we often see on tv or read about in books is very much alive here. my husband was born and bought up here, so he knows the entire block we live in and he has introduced me already to everyone lol.  the people here seem educated and come from well-to-do families, they are culturally rooted - yet they seem progressive. many of their children are pursuing master’s degrees in the us or working in some tech companies or non-tech in bangalore. i was pleasantly surprised by how accepting they are. for example, i would wear short clothes while going for a walk, and unlike in varthur, nobody stared at me angrily.

the temples here are also incredibly beautiful. there are several popular places nearby, like the banashankari 2nd stage market complex, gandhi bazaar, and basavanagudi.

i’m amazed at how different the cultures and vibes can be within the same city. when i lived in varthur, i never imagined bangalore could be so beautiful and welcoming. now that i’m here, i feel incredibly lucky, and i don’t ever want to leave this place. i want to explore the city more and more.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"pahalgam: we’re not citizens anymore. we’re just an audience. 
our biggest failure as a society isn’t just misinformation — it’s apathy toward patterns that repeat with brutal precision. we are being trained to react, not to reflect. and that’s exactly how we’re being governed.

in the wake of the pahalgam terror attack in kashmir, arnab goswami and republic channel have reignited their signature campaign: #wewantrevenge. it’s the same old script — high-pitched rhetoric, performative patriotism, and an unmistakable push to redirect public grief into electoral capital.

we’ve seen this movie before. the last time republic channel beat the war drum like this, the 2019 elections followed. now, between november 2025 and may 2026, six states go to the polls. once again, the media frenzy seems conveniently timed.

what makes it worse is the way state machinery is feeding into this manufactured narrative. the ruling party’s official facebook page recently posted an ai-generated image of the victims, captioned: “ask religion, not caste.” the goal is clear: polarize along communal lines, not question institutional failures.

but here's where the hypocrisy becomes unbearable.

amid all this chest-thumping and talk of revenge, the indian army has quietly been reduced by 180,000 personnel over the last three years. yes — at a time when we’re shouting about national security and calling for retaliation, our defense forces are shrinking.

this isn’t just a statistic. major general g.d. bakshi, a vocal military strategist, has called out this contradiction publicly. he’s asked a simple, powerful question:
“who decided that the indian army has excess manpower? on what basis was this downsizing done — especially when we are facing real, persistent threats on multiple fronts?”

and he’s right.

how does it make sense for a country of 1.4 billion people, where over half the population is under 26 and desperate for stable employment, to cut down the size of the one institution that offers both national service and economic opportunity?

it’s baffling. at a time when we should be expanding recruitment, we’re downsizing. while young people across rural and small-town india queue up for defense exams, the opportunities are being slashed. and yet, the media tells them to bleed for the nation — not to ask why they’re being left out of its future.

but that’s the pattern, isn’t it?

stoke emotion, avoid accountability. turn pain into propaganda. convert tragedy into trps and votes.

we don’t need more slogans.
we need answers.
we don’t need more “revenge.”
we need responsibility.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"current state of india worries me. religious identity politics is a major issue for voting constituencies in india because the population very much votes along demographic identity lines as opposed to the work a politician has done or is set to do. religion is one of the most prominent cleavages along which politicians oftentimes pander and sway the vote, making promises they may never keep while playing the long game of voting that creates further sociopolitical rifts down the road. to vote for someone based on their religion—when that person is not promising social change based upon that religion—is to vote in the wrong direction. it complicates the relationship with leaders who may not provide service projects, development projects, or humanitarian efforts because they think their support is already secured through comorbidity and affiliation as opposed to refugee existence.

this harms the nation over time by promoting communal strife, social dissatisfaction, and a non-nation building mentality. when people vote for someone because they're of the same faith, it fractures potential chemistry as opposed to a streamlined, collaborative, and growth-based instant gratification. thus, politicians don't even have to bother with developmental initiatives. they already got the vote. therefore, this weakens democracy and economic development and prevents the nation from properly solving its most pressing problems.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"psychology pov: “so many people are already voting. i don’t think my vote will make a difference so i’m not voting” what happens when everyone thinks like this? original twitter thread at [https://twitter.com/anushkakumar\_02/status/1782322086020857948](https://twitter.com/anushkakumar_02/status/1782322086020857948) 

full post:  
if many people think “my vote doesn’t matter” and so don’t vote, it will likely have negative outcomes that don’t reflect the preferences of the majority.

voting is a situation in which our behavior is highly dependent on others’ behavior.

i noticed another similar situation happening in my colony but not in the context of voting.

our colony had just provided every flat with a free dustbin that was internally segregated into two compartments—green for wet waste and blue for dry waste.

i thought my mother would use it (instead of our regular non-segregated dustbin) because it’s easy to:

* decide if waste is dry or wet
* throw it in the relevant compartment

but we were still using the regular dustbin (without segregated compartments) and i was surprised.

when i asked my mother the reason for not using the new segregated dustbin, she told me that it was because no one else was using the new segregated dustbin.

(people in our colony kept dustbins outside houses every morning for the garbage collectors to empty our dustbins. and my mother didn’t see the segregated dustbin outside anyone else’s house.)

so when my mother told me the reason that we’re not doing it is because others aren’t doing it, i was again surprised (and disappointed). 

because, what if everyone is thinking that way—we aren’t doing it because others aren’t doing it.

“we aren’t using the segregated dustbins because no one else is using the segregated dustbins”

if everyone thinks that way, then no one will ever use those segregated dustbins. 

i asked her about what’s wrong with us being the first family to use that segregated dustbin.

i reasoned that maybe others will notice us using the segregated dustbin, and they’ll begin using the segregated dustbins too?

imagine how many kilograms of waste can be composted /recycled/reused instead of being thrown into landfills.

imagine the large-scale environmental impact all of this could have. and this could begin from one house taking the lead.

everyone’s seemingly “small” actions ➡️ huge impact.

you see how here, our behavior is highly dependent on others’ behavior (we aren’t doing it because others aren’t doing it) ?

in the dustbin incident, the behavioral phenomenon was social proof/conformity: when we’re unsure of what to do, we tend to do what the majority is doing.

in the voting situation, the phenomenon is diffusion of responsibility/bystander effect: there are so many people. someone else will do the responsible/right thing. my efforts don’t matter.

here’s an example to understand diffusion of responsibility/ bystander effect (and it’s potential large scale outcomes)

suppose there’s an accident on the road.

many people are driving past the victim just because “there are so many other people to help this injured person, why should i be responsible for helping them?”

i think of it as a fraction.

the numerator is 1 (for one responsibility, let’s say, to help the victim) and the denominator is the number of people people present (or let’s say, driving past).

* if there are 10 people driving past, each person feels 1/10 or 10% responsible to help.
* if there are 100,000 people driving past, each person feels 1/10,000 or .001% responsible to help.

more the number of people driving past the accident victim, more the diffusion of responsibility i.e. less responsible each person feels.

even if one person doesn’t give in to diffusion of responsibility and helps the victim, they could save a person’s life.

everyone’s seemingly “small” actions ➡️ huge impact.

apply the same to voting. it’s a phenomenon in which our behavior is highly dependent on others’ behavior.

it’s quite paradoxical because individual actions make up collective actions.

as i said earlier, if many people think “my vote doesn’t matter” and so don’t vote, it will likely have negative outcomes that don’t reflect the preferences of the majority. 

if everyone thinks that their contribution is “too small”, it’ll lead to a large-scale failure to act.

don’t give in to diffusion of responsibility.

everyone’s seemingly “small” actions ➡️ huge impact.

reddit,"what if every indian panchayat had its own official social media page? imagine every panchayat in india had verified pages on instagram, facebook and x, and any resident could post a photo or short video of a local issue and tag the official account for action.  
if a road is broken, a drain is clogged or garbage is piling up, a tagged post becomes a public nudge that is visible to everyone in the area, not just a private complaint that disappears into a call center.

# why this can work

cities like gurugram already route whatsapp, x, facebook and instagram posts into a complaint system that assigns and escalates issues to departments, so the tech and process are not science fiction.  
panchayats also have national digital backbones like egramswaraj that track plans, budgets and assets, which could be linked so a social post becomes a ticket with status and deadlines.

# what a clean flow looks like

a post with a tag generates a ticket id automatically, the system acknowledges it, forwards it to the right team and shows status like received, assigned and resolved in a public dashboard.  
if a ticket is closed without a fix, the complainant can reopen or escalate, using standard grievance rules and local help desks to keep pressure on action rather than pr.

# will politicians allow it

top down policy pushes for digital governance and transparency at the gram panchayat level suggest there is room for this, especially if it plugs into existing platforms rather than creating another app no one maintains.  
but local power dynamics matter and page control, moderation and contractor selection can become gatekeeping points unless the process is codified and audited.

# the obvious risks

official pages can turn into showcase feeds with low follow through if there are no service levels, no escalation and no public reports by ward or department.  
new “page maintenance” contracts can become rent seeking if budgets and kpis are not tied to ticket resolution metrics that anyone can verify.

# simple guardrails to try

make every tagged post a ticket with an id, clock and sla, visible on a public dashboard tied to the panchayat code, so closure claims are checkable by residents and media.  
publish weekly stats by category and location and auto escalate overdue items to block and district officers to avoid silent closures and dead ends.

# what about reach and inclusion

most villages now have some form of internet access and panchayat systems already run on national stacks, so the missing piece is staff training and simple workflows, not raw connectivity alone.  
use whatsapp for intake, keep posts bilingual, and add a call back option so people who cannot compose posts still get tickets created and tracked.

# a quick real world snapshot

gurugram’s authority accepts whatsapp messages with photos and also tracks issues raised on x, facebook and instagram inside its grievance software so they do not vanish in a thread.  
that same idea can scale to rural bodies if ticketing is tied to panchayat profiles in egramswaraj, which already integrates planning, accounting and asset directories with unique codes.

# open questions to the community

1. would elected members support a system where every public tag becomes a timed, visible ticket, or would there be pushback over losing message control ?

  
2. if cities already integrate social media into grievance handling, what stands in the way of a template rollout for panchayats linked to the national portal and codes ?

  
3. how should moderation be handled so genuine posts are not buried, while spam and abuse are filtered without political bias, and what is the right appeal path when a post is taken down ?

  
4. what training, language support and offline options are needed so older residents and low connectivity areas can still create and track tickets without being left out ?",PseudoTopic_0

posting here in frustration and in the hope that someone might be able to help or has gone through something similar.

i stayed at a stanza living property in hsr layout and vacated the flat nearly 4 months ago. as per their rental agreement, the security deposit was to be refunded within 45 days. it’s been over 110 days now, and i’ve still not received the refund.

despite multiple emails, app support tickets, calls to the property manager, and even raising a complaint on the national consumer grievance portal, i’ve received zero communication or resolution.

to add to the mess:
	•	the app shows false deductions for damages (even though the property was handed back in perfect condition).
	•	during the stay, we faced frequent power cuts, no water for bathing, lifts that barely worked, a constantly broken washing machine, and spotty wifi — all while paying full rent on time every month.

i have all the supporting documentation:
	•	agreement
	•	email trails

is anyone else facing similar issues with stanza living in bangalore?
also, would appreciate any leads on lawyers, legal clinics, or steps i can take beyond the consumer portal.

thanks in advance. posting this so others don’t fall for the same experience.",PseudoTopic_0

**difficulty in filing a complaint? call this ngo for assistance**

*it has an 'army' of 10,000 volunteers across bengaluru*

a year old ngo in bengaluru is gaining in popularity for helping out citizens in situations big and small. these include filing firs, finding missing persons and pets, reporting cybercrimes, organising public campaigns, and arranging blood donors and mechanics-for free.

the ngo is called broseph foundation and it has 10,000 volunteers across bengaluru. they have a smaller base in chennai, hyderabad, and pune as well.

its founder dushyant dubey says they may not be successful in resolving all problems but their main aim is to assist people and offer hope that they are ""not alone and helpless"".

the 33-year-old quit his marketing career last year to become a full-time social worker. he had already been volunteering for causes like tribal welfare and education, and was also involved in covid-19 relief work. his friends used to teasingly call him st broseph, an internet slang for a brother one can always turn to.

a reddit post inspired this ngo. he shared, ""three years ago, i wrote on a reddit group that if anybody needed any help in bengaluru, they could reach out to me. i was flooded with messages. people complained of landlord issues, phone snatching and criminal intimidation. women faced stalking and also threats of their photos being leaked online. others had water and power issues.""

dushyant dubey (standing, left) at his ngo in indiranagar. his team comprises six full-time members and 10,000 volunteers.

dubey looked sleepy when metrolife visited his office in indiranagar on wednesday. he had stayed up until 2.30 am to meet a woman who had allegedly faced sexual assault. ""she wanted to know how to take the complaint forward. we try to attend cases 24/7,""he said.

janhavi desai testified to the round-the-clock operation. last year, she had ""called broseph at 2 am"" to track down a person who she feared was suicidal. ""he contacted the police and the guy was found,"" she recalled. today, janhavi has quit her job at a think-tank and oversees cases related to mental health and animal rescue here.

many volunteers are people whom dubey's ""army"" had helped out at some point. today, they are creating databases of ambulances, local police stations and bbmp offices, and affordable mental health services. they accompany people to police stations, government offices, and courts.

earlier, when a case came up. dubey's team would tap into their contacts in ngos, citizen groups, law enforcement and civic offices, and personal and professional networks to find help. ""now, we have figured out the official process,"" he said.

dubey is also reading law books to assist victims better. he explains, ""this january, a gay person was tortured when he went on a 'date' in tavarekere. the police had only filed a case for assault and criminal intimidation. when he approached me, i realised he had also been robbed, wrongfully confined, and subjected to humiliation. we rewrote his complaint and submitted it to the police. they added a few new charges. the accused was apprehended,"" he said.

towards the end of our interview, a woman from hsr layout called him, seeking help to restore her social media account that had been hacked. details on [broseph.in](http://broseph.in)",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"best budget electric guitar &amp; amp recommendations for a budding lead guitarist (india region specific) heyllo there fellow guitarists,

i’m a lead guitarist in a band from small town in ne (india), and we’re about to step up to bigger gigs. right now, i’m using a kadence astroman guitar and a kadence ga-ten amp that came with it, which have worked fine for smaller shows, but now i need to upgrade for bigger events.

my budget is twenty five thousand rupees (preferably under), and i’m looking for a guitar and amp combo that offers good all round genres leaning more into rock/alternative and slight metal tones for lead playing and will last at least five years, ideally closer to ten. the goal is to invest in gear that will grow with us as we take things to the next level.

any suggestions? appreciate your help!

thanks in advance!",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"why is it so difficult to be honest in this country ?  long time pending rant but just wanted to share my experience with getting the gst certificate in india. we were rejected 6 times in the past 6 months with random reasons. 

we first applied in may 2024 with all the documents needed. everything was correct and since we applied at the end of the month, they rejected us saying the electricity bill is old. we thought this was genuine and applied again in mid june. this time we were told the office rent agreement with the owner is not notarized when in fact it was. we thought maybe it was a mistake and we had applied too soon. so, this time we waited for a month and applied in august first week. they rejected us again, citing some random issue. at this point, we were sure it wasn't just the documents that were getting us rejected. so we applied again, with everything verified by a ca to check what was happening. this was september. unsurprisingly, rejected again. each time it took more than a week to get rejected. 

so after getting rejected twice again, we went to the gst office to ask them what's wrong and their response was ""we have rejected no gst registrations in the past 5 months"". at this point, we needed the gstn, as we had to close a contract with a client. so, we asked them what can we do so that it isn't rejected this time. they told us we need to pay for ""extra services"" to get it approved and i kid you not, we applied, paid the ""extra amount"" and got our gst certificate the next day. we did not even submit any new documents. just like that! 

we tried our best to be honest and not pay any ""extra charges"" but how do we deal with this ? this is plain harrasment. and this isn't just one off case. we had a hard time getting our name approved by the mca portal too. even after all services are online, why do these corrupt government officials have the power to do this to us. how to still retain the nationalist spirit when registering for a number that will help the government (literally paying them taxes) takes a fair amount of bribe to execute ? i'm not sure why anyone would register a company or do business here with these experiences.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"how to complain against municipality workers hello

 i'm from odisha. people from municipality came to my street to enlarge the already existing drainage. they dug up the road and broke off the concrete between my home gate and the road to do their works. in the process, they broke pipe supplying water and we're not getting water from motor now. 

first of all, they dug up the whole street but didn't give any prior notice to us regarding it as it impacted our daily lifes about getting vehicles out and in and in general passage. secondly they did this and they didn't inform me about it. i got to know about it in the morning and this arrogant bastard is asking me to get it fixed within evening. now i can't get hold of any plumber. he says if i don't fix it now, they're gonna finish the drainage and then it'll be a very long process to get it done.

they created this problem and then giving me deadlines to fix it. i don't know if i can get any plumber within time but i want to complain about him though. please let me know how i can go about it. i want him to pay for his arrogance.

my neighbour had the same problem and suggests to go about it smoothly. to pay for whatever expenses. why should we compromise and incur expenses for these arrogant bastards mistakes? any inputs will be welcome.

thank you",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"rant: india's power crisis is absolutely embarrassing. it's 2 am. i'm sitting in 40 degree heat, drenched in sweat as i'm writing this. my partner has somehow forced herself to sleep. and my pet is probably too uncomfortable to even say anything. haven't even had dinner since it's so hot, i can't even eat. 

why? no power that's why. 

every summer i see politicians promising adequate power supply and what not. that they're rebuilding infra, improving discoms, reducing shortage etc. and every summer there are power cuts for 4-6 hours long in this terrible heat. early morning, noon, afternoon, evening, night, late night - it's like a little guessing game. and i can't even imagine how people are living in places that have 10-14 hour blackouts every other day. 

i live in gurgaon in a rented flat and that too in a decent locality. the real estate here is hot. yet i don't understand why oh why has the power situation not improved at all. it's so bad that even my inverter has died out. i have barely 20% battery left on my phone. 

why has india not been able to fix its power (and water) crisis? it's been 75 years since independence and yet even the biggest cities here have load shedding. hell, i stay in a city but places in rural india, hinterland, smaller towns have it much much worse. these things are literally the absolute basics to survive after housing, food, clothing. i cannot wrap my mind around the fact that we have this entire parade of politicians and industrialists who beat their chests yet can't even provide a basic necessity like power? matlab kis level ki kaamchori aur corruption hogi ki yeh log bijli ki problem solve nahi kar pa rahe. what is the point of being proud of your achievements if you can't even do your basics right?! 

most of our thermal plants have a huge coal shortage. half of them are not in good condition. transformers are busted and old. no upgrades for better infra. so bc kar kya rahe hai?! i've lived through power cuts for as long as i remember, more than 30 years. and aaj bhi bc raat ko garmi mein baithna padh raha hai. office ka kaam ruka padha hai. the electricity customer care stops taking calls after 9pm. the sdo/linemen stop picking up calls. all i have is a fucking whatsapp chat bot that gives me a complaint number. why should anyone go thru this shit after paying so much tax money? 

it boils my blood that for the suffering of so many people in india, a few corrupt mofos get away. there are so many places in india where power hasn't even reached. or only get 4-5 hours of power every day. and yet you have power ministers nicely living in homes with 10+ acs. 

of course, we are to blame as well. we are way too many people for the amount of power we produce. just can't deal with the load. plus the elite bougee crowd jo ek hi ghar mein 4 ac use karte hai. 

but as a country, don't we deserve at least this much? bc poora desh ko inn mantriyon ne bech daala hai. and then you have all the pr machinery, all the optics, all the fucking roadshows and shosha and tomtoming about ""look india is such a great country, fastest economy vishwaguru blah blah"" 

abey kya lowde ka economy karoge agar ghar mein bijli hi nahi hai? kya fayda yeh sab show off karne ka jab dikhaane ke liye kuchh hai hi nahi?! kya karoge aise politicians ko support karke and following their cheapass religious narrative? first world country ke naam pe kya hi ukhaad liya tumne jab basic facilities like law and order, infra, healthcare, employment, education hi nahi de paaye?! 

so so so sooooo fed up with the state of affairs. and electricity crisis is not even our biggest concern. it's just one of the few that the privileged are used to. corruption, dogmatism, exploitation, doglapan, yehi karte rahenge sab. 

i love this country and i love its beautiful people. this is not a rant against india. but against those who run the state, those who give fake promises and exploit the people's money and effort, those who spit on the dignity of hard working tax paying citizens, and those who support these guys knowing how evil they are. 

rant over. 

ps: i want to know what you guys think should be the solution to india's power crisis. what kind of technologies should we adapt? should solar be used more extensively? how can consumers like us help in better power management? or can we come together in someway and question the ones responsible for this? will india ever come out of this situation or even get 30-40% better than what it is today? 

i repeat, this is not a hate post. just an epiphany about where we are right now. 

i wish kisi ko bhi aisi naubat na aaye ki woh june ki garmi mein raat ke 3 baje bina electricity ghar mein baithe ho.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"please be cautious of any foodstuff you buy from local vendors i experience a little indigestion and that's specifically why i had decided to include a glass of lassi in my diet to keep my stomach intact. i had a specific dairy from where i bought malai lassi every single time. however, my family and a few friends recommended me a new vendor who makes fresh lassi every day for his customers. i was buying lassi from him for about a month so far.

yesterday, while scrolling through reddit, my eyes suddenly went through the recent mountain dew feud. i was surprised by their statement that the rat's flesh, if present, would have melted into a jelly-ish structure in the soda can. at that time, i didn't know why that thought was in my mind while going to buy a lassi for myself.

usually i just buy and slurp lassi without giving another thought. but i don't know what made me do it, but i just closed my eyes and said, ""jesus."" i was eating a bit of malai on the top of my glass, and took a spoon of lassi. to my utter shock, there was a spider in my lassi. i immediately stopped, and showed it to the vendor. i spit all of it out, and the vendor bought me some water to gargle. i think i might've eaten a bit of the malai on the top. i hope that's not harmful, given my indigestion problem.

in retrospect, i feel like i should've taken a picture, but i was too focused on getting the lassi out of my mouth. had i not read that feud yesterday, or had i bought a full glass malai lassi, i might have actually slurped the spider in, i guess...

so please always check your food out before you eat, especially when you buy a take-out. also, maybe a little spirituality might help, i guess?

take care, everybody :)",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"the petulance !  **this post has been written by 3 parts of me**  
the inner critic , the inner child, and the inner adult.

i am 40 years olf. lovely wife. 2 kids.

i have certain borderline traits, but over time, with dbt and cbt, my mindset has changed and i have really ensured that the trauma i have does not get passed to my kids. this may sound like a lot of could and would and should and what ifs, but i think i need to tell this story.  
  
i'm not the best at what i do, but i work hard.  
there's a lot of stress i take for work, and that's not going to go away. my wife also expects a lot from me, and i like making her happy. so that’s not going to go away either.

my wife earns more than i do, and that’s perfectly okay. if i could be a stay at home dad, i would love it.

i had a breakdown in 2022 at work, couldn't manage my emotions well, and started talking about killing myself.  
  


 

the incident got escalated, and i had to leave that job. that made me realise that it takes only 1 slip to make you from favorite to failure.  
  
in 2023, i got admitted to the hospital due to a tia (a minor minor stroke)

i quit my job last january and decided to take a plunge into consulting.  my wife was so supportive. my whole family was. and it worked well, i immediately gopt 2 contracts for the first 6 months.  
  


from january to june, i was working as a retainer consultant. now the retainer contracts are over, and i'm trying to get business. i decided to give it a year.

and now, somehow i am less stressed setting up consulting than i was in my job.  
  
when i got the initial assignments, i thought this consulting thing was easy, and i got cocky. but now i'm out in the water, trying to get my business off the ground. there are days when i like doing it, but when i don't see an immediate result, it makes me feel a fear of failure and a lack of validation.  
  
but all said and done, despite the stress of setting up a consulting business, i am so much happier and my relationships with people have improved. somehow, i'm much less stressed than i was earlier.

**but i am having a panic attack right now!**

  
when i quit, my assumption was that we could run the house on her salary (she earns thrice of what i do).

my wife and i just sat on finances .we're still falling short. and this is at our lowest expense, it cannot go any further than this.  
we will need money. and i cannot be the one not pitching in,  
hence the panic attack

**central question** :

if i get a job, our money woes will be solved, but then i will go back to the nervous wreck i was or if not that then for sure i will have a slip up and that’s not going to go down well. it happened in 2022 where i had a nervous breakdown at work. and in 2023 i was admitted to the hospital because of a transient ischemic stroke. all it takes is 1 slip up.  
  
  
**anytime i have held a job** –

there has not been a day i have not stressed about delivering over and above. it is just ingrained in me. i used to work in a really toxic industry and anyways i had to spend nights, and had to face a lot at work (bipolar boss, constant yelling etc..). but that is just what it is. i cant change the way the industry works.  
on top of that i tried to reach a very high standard so more than others, i expected a lot from myself . i have managed to work on this and actually aim for excellence.  
  
**personality traits !**  
i am curious, empathetic, and persevering. i'm not the best at anything, but i love learning. i'm an anxious person by nature, i need a lot of validation, and i want to make everyone around me happy and meet everyone's expectations.  
  
sometimes, i learn for validation, but many times i love learning just for the heck of it. i will learn psychology, mythology, philosophy, sociology, physics, biology, anything. i love a life of quiet contemplation, writing and reading.

**ut now**  
  
**i am having a panic attack. my inner critic is getting louder. my what ifs are putting me in a psace where i fear for everything. i cannot breathe.**

i have some options in front of me.

i have 3 options:

**option 1**

get a job immediately and give up trying to set a business: i've been working in an industry which is really toxic. i'm more sensitive than most, and i'm zero on office politics. i spend a lot of time at work – i work really long hours. it's not a problem with me, everyone in the industry faces this. it just hits me harder because my work gives me a lot of validation.

positives: that would solve our money issues immediately.

negatives: work long hours, be stressed, lose spending time with kids, stressful situation with my wife, not meeting her expectations, not meeting kids expectations, not meeting my own expectations

what if i break down again! what if i slip again. now i cannot afford it, because this is going to cost me a lot!  
  
**option 2**

continue to try and set up consulting

positives – drive which comes from within, being able to monetise my full set of skills, being able to do different kinds of work. in the long run, i am pretty confident that i sould be able to earn more than what i would make in a job, with much less stress.  
i get to spend time with my kids, i get to see them grow up and i get to see my lovely wife and make sure i seduce her every day. somehow, i am nor as worried about this taking off. but the minor chance that this wont tyake off is still a luxury we cannot take  
  
negatives – a chance of failure. we will be spending more than we earn.  
though i have given myself a year, what if i quit consulting in june, only to figure out that my big break was coming in july, or what if i am not good enough  
  
**option 3**  
take a job which is less stressful and toxic

positives – obviously less stress. less money, but manageable.  
no negatives as such, but will be tough. i don’t know how to do anything else, going to school is not an option. i would love for someone to hire me, but switching careers at 40 is tough.

i would really like to believe that i will be able to handle all emotions with grace and honour but some times the dbt and cbt exercises don’t serve me at all and i get emotionally distressed. trouble is, i cannot have  another breakdown at work. but if i don’t get a job, we may have to live beyond our means for a while. and if i do get a job, what if i break down?  
  
the adult says it sound like i am looking for excuses to go back to a job and be miserable in an environment i know over trying to work as a consultant and get out of my comfort zone.  
  
the critic says – you are doomed either ways

reddit,"is bescom actually getting.. better!? before you pounce on me with frequent power cuts and the infamous ""load shedding"" let me just say, i know! based on the locality, people would have had different experiences. 

but this post is about their helpline. from last few months, it has been very handy! whenever there are power cuts, i call them and a real person picks up on the other side usually under a minute. if it's scheduled maintenance, i'm given an eta. if not, they register a complaint and in most case power is restored in about 15 - 20 minutes!

now the cherry on top, there was a power cut in the middle of the night yesterday. i decided to give it a shot and called them at 1 am and was pleasantly surprised to connect to a person! as usual, she raised the complainant and power was back in 15 minutes.

is this just me or anyone else have noticed this?",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"my week-long nightmare with a new samsung machine &amp; their abysmal service in marathahalli, bengaluru. hey everyone,

posting here to vent and warn anyone considering a major appliance purchase in bengaluru. i'm currently in the middle of a customer service black hole with samsung and i'm at my wit's end.

we were excited to get a new samsung washing machine delivered on **august 30th**. that excitement lasted about five minutes.

here’s the timeline of the circus so far:

* **aug 30 (friday):** machine is installed. the technician rushes through it and leaves. we discover it’s doa (dead on arrival) – it won't even draw water.
* **sep 1 (sunday):** after a 2-day wait, a technician finally visits. he tinkers with it, fails to complete a single cycle, and leaves. the machine now has a *new* problem: it won't expel water. so he actually made it worse.
* **sep 1-2 (sun-mon):** we call the technician, who, without visiting, decides it must be our ""electric supply socket"" and tells us to replace it. we spent the next day on multiple calls to the installation center insisting that our power supply is perfectly fine.
* **sep 3 (wednesday):** we get a confirmed appointment for 3:50 pm. we clear our schedules and wait. and wait. **complete no-show. no call, no text, no apology.** we tried calling the assigned engineer multiple times, but no response.
* **sep 4 (thursday):** after we escalate (again), a different guy shows up at 4 pm. he looks at the machine and says he'll be back *tomorrow* (today) to fix it.
* **sep 5 (today, friday):** surprise, surprise... another **no-show**. when we called him, he just said he'd come ""tomorrow."" fed up, we called samsung's main customer care line to escalate further. their ""solution""? they told us our service update was for a technician to visit on **september 8th!** another three-day wait, scheduled without even asking us.

so now i have a brand new, expensive samsung machine sitting in my home like a 40kg paperweight. we've wasted hours chasing people down, only to be met with incompetence and broken promises.

has anyone else in bengaluru (especially marathahalli area) faced this kind of service from samsung? is there a magic word to get them to just take back their defective product and issue a refund? i'm done with repairs.

**tl;dr:** bought a new samsung machine. it was dead on arrival. the service experience has been a cascade of failures: multiple no-shows, incorrect remote diagnoses, and technicians who either make the problem worse or don't show up at all. now stuck with a dead machine for over a week and samsung thinks a service date of sep 8th is acceptable.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"india is actually a good country to live if you can live in a village  m 22. 
i make about ₹70k per month and work from home, so i’ve chosen to live in my village, thirthahalli, in karnataka. life here is peaceful, with no noise or air pollution. while there are plenty of complaints about india these days in reddit but i choose to see the good part of where i live . for the taxes i pay, i feel i get decent facilities, like good roads even in rural areas. sure, the heavy rainfall damages them as this is a heavy rainfall region, but potholes are usually fixed within a month. the air is fresh, and quality food is just a 2 km bike ride away in the nearby taluk town. a ₹100 biryani here rivals the taste of top bangalore restaurants. electricity is almost free, and people are friendly and helpful.

when i get bored, i grab my fishing rod and head to the river. living here lets me enjoy a balanced, peaceful life while earning well. clean air, good infrastructure, affordable food, and a supportive community make me feel like i’ve made the right choice. for me, this simplicity and connection to nature outweigh the chaos of city living. 

i lived in bangalore for four years during my studies and hated the constant traffic. now, living in my village, i enjoy the freedom of less crowded roads and the calmness of rural life. being surrounded by dogs, birds, cows, and sometimes even snakes (haha) makes me feel much closer to nature. i stick to a 40-hour workweek, which gives me enough time to upskill, pursue hobbies, and truly enjoy my free time.

during engineering, i had different ambition . dreaming of living a cozy life in a fancy bangalore apartment and working endlessly to make a ton of money. but my perspective on life has completely changed now. it’s not that i’ve given up on ambitions like switching companies or improving my skills to earn more, but i no longer chase these goals at the expense of my peace of mind. life here feels more balanced, and that’s what matters to me the most. 

adding some photos of my life in village:

i live in virar. and although virar is considered city know, it's act like village only. no proper traffic rules. our station side is filled with soo many rickshaws that walking is difficult and driving there is practically impossible only. roads are build only when some big event is going to happen and will last for those event only. everywhere there is pot holes, soo big i almost got in accident because of one. in a particular area even water supply isn't given yet, they have prep everything but aren't giving them the water, those area people have to relly on tankers regularly. every know and than they will say will start the water service but than delay it saying some work is still pending. such thing been happening for 2 years know. the side walk system practically doesn't exist. people park there bike on side walk. or some even drive there. cleanliness is no where to be found in here. and civil sense as always no where to be found. but the biggest problem of all is electricity. it's cut of is soo regular that if some day it doesn't go we are shocked that it didn't went out. everyday for 5 min to 2 hours electricity cut off will be there without any reason no matter what season, day it is. and after cutting light regularly they also sechdule 8 or more hours of power cut on friday. people don't understand that is a big chunk of time and in that time if u don't have inverter, u practically staying without fan in summer. our service provider is mseb, an government company that works like shit. when we call to know why electricity is not there they won't pick the call up only and even if they did they would just say u can file the complaint whate else. they won't tell us why exactly there are soo many power cuts. i have lived here for more than 15 years. and for whole 15 years i have faced this problem. and fact the service of this company is sooo bad yet government is doing nothing at all. i have even tried to file complain once on call and once on website. there website lag soo much it takes atleast 1/2 hour to get it fully load. after 5 hours of electricity cut we don't even have network. so we sit without any internet, we can't call anyone. we can't do time pass on phone. and due to sudden power cuts we our tv 2 times had to go under repair. our ac had to go under repair. we got an very good inverter but it didn't even lasted 5 years before we had to change it again. it's just assumptions but this  electricity cuts are way of bossiting inverter business. and it's happening all over vasai virar. i am tired of having to go through 8 hours straight without electricity. and not to mention they will cut light off at any time. at 7 am, at 3 pm, at 5 pm at 9 pm at 12 am, yes even at night. i am tired as hell. mseb, u are a very shit company and because of such government company our india will never ever be developed, because they don't do there jobs.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"what's with government digging up a well constructed road just to repair it and dig it again in january our municipal corporation thought to improve the drainage systems by installing new underground pipes. so they dug up the road and after their work was finished they didn't bother to repair it for a month. then in march they repaired the road only to be dug up again because now they are going to fit a more ""bigger"" concrete pipe underground for better sewage. i was like ""why couldn't they do that earlier"".
after digging the road they once again took 15 days to repair it. 

then came april and you know what they dug up the road yet another time. and again it caused a lot of problems. because it was harder for people to take out their cars and bikes. and can lead to accidents because how bad they constructed it after that. now it's june and behold another digging. i am literally frustrated from all the noise they are producing because the digging starts after 12 am. why can't they just dig it once do what they want to install and finish it all at once. like why start digging if you don't have all the equipments which you're gonna install.",PseudoTopic_0

assam flood is one of the devastating climatic disaster which occurs every year and simply neglected by both of the state and central government. the netizens of silchar assam shall never forget all the fake promises the government in action had made shouting in front of crores of people that they'll make the state get rid of flood within few years. years passed , no action had been taken at all and now my hometown silchar is sinking, starving, and fighting for survival. 
no food !
no electricity! 
no reliable network to communicate!
no route to go out! 
nothing! 
the entire city is almost at the verge of sinking. 
people like me who belong to silchar but are staying in different parts of india for higher studies and jobs right now are waiting to get one damn call from home to hear their parents, family members and friends voice and know that they're okay. the heart wrenching scenes and the havoc of the disaster is terrifying. four days have passed and the people are still holding on with the hope to be helped and praying that the next morning the water level might drop at least by an inch. 
let's hold on.
pray for my hometown as i plead. 
let's pray and stay strong. 
it shall pass. 
assam is witnessing the worst flood in the history of northeast india

over 55 lakh people affected, 100+ died, there is no electricity from 60+ hours, acute shortage of drinking water and food.

all transportaction access are blocked due to major landslides along meghalaya and mizoram roadways.

a small town called silchar is facing an emergency with water level going above danger level. dead bodies are floating in the water, with no place to cremate.

and to make the situation worse, 30+ dacoits are roaming in the town with guns and knife at midnight.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"regular cases of sexual violence in india: thinking beyond surface level outrage. the recent varanasi rape case might assemble people to outrage once again because its news has gone viral. this outrage is a little too soon this time. just 8 months after the kolkata case. everyday news of rapes here and there does not call for action and only takes one scroll to get over with.

official data shows that around 30,000 rape cases are reported in india every year. but:

* we also have a sense that not all cases (especially when family is involved, or marital rapes) are reported to the authorities.
* the conviction rate in the reported cases is ridiculously low.
* public anger tends to erupt only when a case becomes ""viral"" — if it fits the pattern that media and algorithms reward.

even in those cases, we never really go beyond, ""hang the rapists publically"" or ""cut off their genitals"" etc. **rape is not a deviation from society, it is a reflection of how society is built**"".



before figuring out what punishment is best for which crime, it is necessary to look for the reasons.

* **patriarchy** hands over this power to men. it limits the movement and freedom of the majority of women, which makes them secluded at home and in public spaces.
* in **caste hierarchies,** the ""upper"" caste men assert dominance on the one hand by restricting women's relationships and on the other hand through sexual violence towards women from other castes. urban sexual violence often gets media coverage — but rural and caste-based violence is normalized and invisibilized.
* **capitalism and the capitalist mode of production** thrive on profit and competition. the competition and the economic despair among the low-income workers lead to their alienation from society, killing community living. the more the alienation, the more disempowered and violent men become physically and verbally.
* in such **capitalist** systems, the least powerful are the women from lower-income households, especially from dalit, bahujan, and adivasi communities. you'd say, ""but america is also capitalist"". america and europe do not thrive on their own. they stand at the top of the capitalist structure exploiting the global south population since forever.
* the capitalist mode of production also thrives on the objectification of women. other than marketing and films, it brings social media numbers. the alienated men feel empowered when they collectively ridicule the oppressed. in other words, the more dank, edgy (or insensitive) your comedian or commenter is, the more clout he brings to the systems furthering the chain of alienation.
* the mainstream media (which only has a profit motive) will pay attention to a rape case only if you talk about it. it will ignore 100 other cases if you choose to worship your political leader or your favorite comedian.
* this whole ecosystem of conservative and liberal media (news, films, comedy, ads, social media content, etc) ignores the daily systemic violence in homes, fields, factories, and police stations that feeds the larger picture. but if a popular woman says anything south of what our patriarchal values taught us, she is a feminist and feminism is getting out of hand.
* lastly, our country's **education system** is a toothless paper tiger with no tools to solve the problems discussed above.

so what can we really do? forget about it. india is not ready for india's tumor.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"79 years of breaking the chains- an analysis of india's independence it has been seventy nine years since india gained independence from foreign rule. for centuries we lived under the control of first islamic invaders and later european colonial powers. we were not only robbed of wealth, but also stripped of our political agency, cultural confidence, and standing in the world. when independence finally arrived in 1947, it came alongside one of the greatest human tragedies in modern history. the partition displaced over fourteen million people and took the lives of as many as two million. families that had lived together for generations were torn apart. imagine living in the only home you have ever known, enduring generations of subjugation, and just as the oppressors leave, your own brothers and sisters are told to go forever. that was the reality for millions.

yet from that devastation, the country began to rise. our leaders planted the seed of democracy, giving us a constitution in 1950 that granted every adult the right to vote. at that time, this was something few democracies in the world had achieved so early. suddenly, those in power were coming to the people’s doorsteps asking for votes. institutions like the iits and iims opened their doors to all. untouchability was abolished, and people once considered outside the social order could now compete on the basis of merit. it was a time of transformation and optimism. we rebuilt our economy and our self-confidence. the green revolution in the 1960s ensured that the country could feed itself. in 1991, economic reforms opened new opportunities. scientists such as vikram sarabhai and homi bhabha made us a spacefaring nation. we reached the moon and mars. in education, technology, and social policy, we achieved progress that earlier generations could not have imagined.

but alongside these achievements, a more difficult question remains. are we truly free? political independence removed the foreign ruler, but does every citizen today enjoy the freedom to live with dignity, without fear, and without barriers? some chains remain, created not by outsiders but by our own systems and society.

one area that demands attention is the state of our constitutional bodies. these were created to stand above politics, to act as the guardians of the constitution, and to protect the rights of citizens. at times in our history, they have lived up to that duty. the election commission, for example, under t. n. seshan in the 1990s, became a symbol of fearlessness, enforcing the model code of conduct strictly and showing that no political party was beyond scrutiny. and the same election body is losing its credibility faster than the politicians it conducts. 

the media, once celebrated as the fourth pillar of democracy, is increasingly concentrated in the hands of a few corporate houses, making it harder for diverse voices to be heard. i have personally experienced how fragile these freedoms can be. i once spoke at a cultural programme on independence day in a news studio. moments after mentioning a peaceful protest happening nearby, the recording was stopped. i was told to avoid talking about the problems of the country. this was not even a state-owned channel. it became clear to me in that moment how easily the right to speak can be curtailed, not just by the state, but by institutions that fear its displeasure.

i think of a dalit friend who works in top management at microsoft. his colleagues, unaware of his caste, spoke in degrading terms about dalits right in front of him. he chose to remain silent, fearing that speaking out could harm his career. can we truly say he is free? the lgbtq community still does not have the legal right to marry. people are judged for whom they love, and denied the same rights as others. economic inequality also challenges our idea of freedom. youth unemployment remains high despite growth. workers in the gig economy often lack basic protections. environmental degradation is displacing indigenous communities and making air and water unsafe for millions. digital freedoms face threats from surveillance and frequent internet shutdowns. gender-based violence continues to be widespread, with justice often delayed.

freedom from colonial rule was only the first step. true liberation means freedom from poverty, prejudice, fear, and systemic injustice. it means living in a society where constitutional values are not just ideals on paper but a reality experienced by every citizen. the question is no longer whether we achieved independence. the question is whether we have been able to protect and expand it.

happy independence day!

reddit,"they call it progress. i call it extinction in the name of development — great nicobar deserves better. i’m not against development.
i’m against the kind of “development” that forgets who it’s supposed to serve.

what’s happening in great nicobar island isn’t nation-building — it’s a gamble. a ₹44,000 crore gamble with earthquakes, forests, and the lives of people who’ve lived there peacefully for centuries.

they call it a transshipment hub — a “new singapore.” but what they won’t tell you is that thousands of hectares of dense evergreen forest will be cut, that it lies in a high seismic zone, and that the shompen and nicobarese tribes — our fellow indians — will be displaced from their ancestral homes.

all this for a dream that looks glamorous on paper, but cracks under reality.

there is a better way.

we already have deep ports — vizhinjam, paradip, tuticorin, kamarajar — capable of handling massive ships with minor upgrades. strengthening these would cost less, employ more, and won’t destroy a single rainforest.

we can still secure our oceans.
build smaller naval bases powered by solar and wind, not entire cities.
construct an airport for connectivity — yes — but not an artificial singapore on a fragile island.

and while we talk about infrastructure — let’s build schools, hospitals, and communication networks there first. let the people of nicobar live better before we decide how to make the land “profitable.”

if costa rica can preserve 60% of its forests and still thrive economically, why can’t india?
why must our development always start with destruction?


we’ve seen this story before.

remember the big “masterstroke” cities?
dholera — still on paper.
amravati — never became real.
and even when they do get built, what happens next?

take atal setu — the pride of mumbai. grand budget, huge inauguration, and now within months, people complain about tolls, vibrations, lane bottlenecks, and poor maintenance.
if that’s the condition of a bridge near the financial capital, imagine what will happen to something built thousands of kilometres away, on an island prone to earthquakes and tsunamis.

we’ve seen this over and over:
build fast. spend big. forget later.

and each time, it’s the same photo-op, the same glamour, the same promise of “visionary leadership” — and the same silence when the ground starts cracking.

the truth is simple.

the great nicobar doesn’t need another singapore.
it needs sustainable connection, not commercial invasion.
it needs our protection, not our pride.

because when you destroy an island for ambition, you don’t just lose land — you lose culture, biodiversity, and the conscience of a nation.

the people who live there are not “backward” — they are the real india.
they live with nature, not over it. and it’s time we learn from them instead of displacing them.


to those who say “we need progress”

yes, we need power. yes, we need ports.
but what we don’t need is thoughtless progress — the kind that looks good on a poster but collapses under truth.

we can strengthen the mainland ports, modernize existing infrastructure, and still achieve what this project promises — without losing what makes india unique.

our rulers today love to build for cameras — massive budgets, big words, and bigger statues — but when it comes to building trust, they’re bankrupt.

if this project was truly for india’s future, it would begin with the people, not bulldozers.
it would protect forests, not feed the hunger of a few men hiding behind “national interest.”


the real development

real development isn’t when we turn every forest into concrete — it’s when every child has a school, every villager has clean water, every soldier has safety, and every tree still has a place to grow.

let’s not forget — this is our land, our ocean, our people.
if the government truly represents us, it should listen to us.
because when the last tree falls and the last tribe leaves, the port will stand tall — but the soul of india will be gone.

reddit,"ola electric’s service network in india is a complete disaster: 118 out of 135 cities have zero available service slots i’m absolutely furious. i’ve been digging into ola electric’s “service network” in india, and what i found is a complete disaster. out of 135 cities i checked, 118 have zero available service slots. their centers are basically empty shells, yet ola continues to list them as “operational” on their app and website. people trying to book services are met with nothing for weeks or even months. cities like ahmedabad, surat, vadodara, rajkot, gandhinagar, bhuj, daman, diu, and many more are completely affected.

ola sells these scooters with fancy marketing hype about “revolutionizing mobility,” but after purchase, getting support is nearly impossible.

there is no proper after-sales network, spare parts are scarce, and customer service treats you like you’re bothering them. customers are left stranded with broken scooters, waiting endlessly for basic maintenance or repairs. this isn’t just bad business; it’s reckless and irresponsible. the company takes advantage of government subsidies and expansion hype while failing miserably to service the very products they sell.

for those who want specifics, here’s the list of cities in gujarat where ola’s service centers are essentially useless: ahmedabad, surat, vadodara, jamnagar, gandhinagar, nadiad, surendranagar, bharuch, vapi, veraval, porbandar, godhra, bhuj, anand, gandhidham, palanpur, valsad, navsari, botad, amreli, dwarka, ankleshwar, kalol, dahod, rajpipla, mahuva, modasa, himmatnagar, idar, vyara, wadhwan, una, palitana, mandvi, thangadh, viramgam, lunawada, khambhat, daman, diu, mangrol, babra, kadi, visnagar, mansa, petlad, kapadvanj, wadi, padra, dabhoi, savli, kheda, tarapur, karjan, dholka, dhandhuka, limbdi, dhrangadhra, chotila, dasada, halvad, lakhtar, rapar, bhachau, nakhatrana, mundra, adipur, anjar, bhimasar, dhrol, kalyanpur, okha, khambhalia, sikka, jamkhambhaliya, lalpur, bhanvad, ranavav, kutiyana, miyani, sutrapada, kodinar, talala, visavadar, maliya, vanthali, manavadar, kunkavav, bhesan, gadhada, dhola, savarkundla, bagasra, lathi, liliya, khambha, rajula, jafrabad, talaja, mahuva, gariadhar, songadh, uchchhal, malegaon, bardoli, mandvi, kamrej, olpad, mangrol, umarpada, valod, nizar, chikhli, vansda, dharampur, pardi, umbergaon, kaprada.

this is a nightmare for anyone who has bought or is considering buying an ola scooter. fancy ads and government subsidies cannot make up for a company that cannot even service its own products. if you’re thinking of buying one, stop right now. save your money and sanity, and go with a brand that actually supports its customers.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"what’s it gonna take for us as a society to finally care about air quality and climate change on a mass scale?  as an indian residing overseas, i visit india about twice a year and every time after i land, i get either a nasal infection, itchiness or face allergies which are not gone until i go back to my country of residence. doctors often point out that it is the reaction to the extreme air pollution. i know many people who face similar issues. living in an indian metropolis is equivalent to smoking multiple cigarettes daily. 

— i’m deeply concerned about the lack of widespread action and the unmuted response to the environmental emergencies. 

- we owe it to our parents who deserve to breathe fresh air in their golden years, to fellow citizens l, and future generations. they should inherit the nation that’s as beautiful and bountiful as its meant to be. 

- it goes beyond health. imagine getting unobscured view of the himalayas and our country being lauded for the beauty and cleanliness and us becoming a leader in promoting a cleaner and pristine natural environment, globally.

- in my country of residence , germany, parties are solely formed on the basis of environmental issues. ( green party for example) and elections can make or break on the basis of environmental issues.

- this also has to do with what we as a society demand from our law and policy makers. here i observe a huge pressure from the general population to breathe fresh air, get clean water and access to a ton of natural beauty to make living more fulfilling. 

- we are still way focussed on topics such as communal and religious politics, in an unhealthy proposition. 

- i am sure many people who have been in other parts of the world also more or less notice it. but it still hasn’t become a mainstream issue. none of the election  manifestos emphasise on those topics. i wonder what is it going to take to finally that to happen! 




edit: a lot of people are straight up jumping to developed cvs developing country comparison. my question is, is physics and ecology going to care and wait until your, mine and our loved ones’ bodies have permanent damages? are the ice glaciers going to wait for the next 50 years until india is developed and the wrongdoing in the past by other countries are balanced before cities like mumbai are submerged? and other extreme weather conditions? also why cannot we make our living conditions better if we see an obvious problem instead of jumping into ‘what-aboutism’ ?",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"broken road near mahadevpura–whitefield, how do i escalate this? hey everyone,

the main road connecting mahadevpura and whitefield near my area is in a terrible state — full of potholes and broken patches. apart from being unsafe, it always forces vehicles to slow down drastically, which in turn causes massive jams during peak hours.

i honestly don’t expect much to change, but i at least want to officially raise a complaint/request so that it’s on record. does anyone here know the proper procedure or platform where i can escalate this? (bbmp? some online portal/app? or do we need to contact local representatives directly?)

would really appreciate any guidance or if anyone has had success with something similar.

thanks!",PseudoTopic_0

why the fuck we dont protest? 

our politicians are very uneducated and corrupt except few and educated civil servants are always at threat by them. every person's goal is now to become rich and leave india 

air pollution, low wages, low civic sense, tax waivering most people don't pay taxes and people who do are also not given any benefits like roads infrastructure clean water/ air electricity, vip culture as we saw in messi event even if u get hit by rich kid's porsche nothing happens 

diabetes capital rape capital least on happiness index highest power very low per capita income very shitty civics infrastructure and civic servants 

i can name thousands of more problems and it can be solved china solved aqi problem and usa and other european countries are also very good about this type of issues 

anyone wanna protest if 1m people protest at once then government gonna shit there pants 

also biggest thing is religion caste sect and now language based riots

reddit,"for all prospective students going abroad on loans: don't. it's no longer worth it. whether we admit it or not, everyone goes to the west to make more money. all the chatter about culture, pollution, potholes, missing family, visa, food, etc. is all secondary to this. otherwise, people would be immigrating to bhutan too.

so i'm presenting a purely financial argument here. run the exact nos. before making this decision. i'll give the example of usa:

* highest salaries in the world
* highest tuition fees and living costs in the world
* intl students are charged full sticker price, while citizens get a much lower price
* interest rates upwards of 12% since fed rate hike and you are risky borrowers with no credit history

if americans find it tough to repay their loans with lower tuition and 2-3% interest rates, imagine the burden on you when things are 180\* for you and you come from a much lower ppp country.

even if you get a high-paying job, it'll take you well over a decade to recoup your investment. it's legal servitude, since the workforce in the west is dwindling they need young indentured workers to toil hard and make money from them.

reddit,"footpaths optional? moved to bangalore three months ago. staying near madiwala and walking to koramangala for work. i assumed footpaths were meant for walking. that assumption was wrong.

footpaths here are treated like free real estate. garbage dumped directly on them, shop boards and standees blocking the way, small vendors occupying whatever space is left, and bikes and cars parked neatly across the rest. most days, i end up walking on the road instead of the footpath.

it gets worse during traffic. two wheelers casually use the footpath as an alternate lane. i have almost been hit multiple times. when i call them out, i get yelled at as if i’m the problem.

the funny part is this: the moment i take out my phone to take a picture, everyone suddenly remembers that footpaths are not roads. they quietly move back. so they know it’s wrong. they just don’t care unless there’s proof.

if walking 2 km without risking your life is too much to ask, what exactly are footpaths for in this city?",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"what my marriage taught me about finding the right partner let me share a personal story that might resonate with those of you searching for a life partner. it’s not easy to admit, but my first marriage was a complete disaster. it ended painfully in divorce, and i want to tell you what i learned from it.

my ex-partner struggled with bipolar disorder—a condition that was never disclosed or treated. in our society, mental health issues carry a heavy stigma and are often swept under the rug. there’s an unspoken expectation that marriage itself will fix everything. i, too, believed that.

when i look back, i realize how naive i was. like many young people, i was full of confidence and optimism, assuming love alone could conquer all. i ignored glaring red flags—unpredictable bursts of anger, irrational behavior—thinking i could handle them.

after my divorce, i rebuilt my life in middle age and promised myself i’d do something to help others avoid the mistakes i made. that’s when i started exploring the power of psychometric assessments—tools widely used in corporate settings to evaluate personalities and behaviors.

i worked on adapting these tools for relationships. imagine a system that could:

* evaluate someone’s approach to conflict, communication, and emotional resilience.
* help you identify potential red flags before committing.
* recommend the kind of partner who would align with your personality and values.

it’s not about finding perfection—it’s about making informed decisions. these assessments can even guide you in creating an attractive profile that showcases your true self, cutting down wasted time and energy during your partner search.

marriage isn’t magic—it’s hard work, understanding, and self-awareness. if you’re serious about finding the right partner, consider looking into solutions that help you know yourself better and approach relationships with clarity.

you can check out my [website here](https://knotrite.in)

what’s your take? would you trust an approach like this in your journey to finding “the one”?

  
**update: addressing some feedback**

i completely understand that many redditors are wary of posts that seem like advertisements or promotions. however, i want to assure you that my story is 100% true and deeply personal.

my venture wasn’t born out of a business idea—it came from the darkest moments of my life and a heartfelt desire to ensure others don’t have to endure the same pain. that’s why i chose to share it here.

i genuinely believe that this initiative can positively impact lives and, in the bigger picture, contribute to meaningful societal change. thank you for reading, and i truly hope my intentions come through.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"another monument in bengaluru gba’s roadwork quality is an absolute joke at this point. instead of doing proper resurfacing with milling, levelling and compaction, they keep churning out these lazy, “throw‑and‑roll” patches that look good for one photo and then start breaking apart with the first bout of rain and traffic.

 the administration loves to boast about thousands of potholes filled and big action plans, but posts like this just expose how little they care about durability, safety or value for taxpayer money, turning bengaluru’s roads into a recurring contract rather than a one‑time fix.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"the garden city movement! hi, if you've taken a trip on our highways, you will notice huge sections of land where there are no trees and the land is just dead. there are tons of spots in the city that are barren as well.

what can we do? - we can create small micro forests within these spaces, it'll slowly expand over time(2-5yrs)and restore the land. will help birds, insects and small animals. perhaps veggies/fruits for those who wish to forage. restoring the land requires mostly water and care. given how often it rains in and around bangalore, water shouldn't be a problem, catchment is. manpower can be from this sub? like a reddit sub driven initiative,. perhaps even house the subs already existing meetups. its low cost to execute, good for the planet and gives us a reason to get on the highways on weekends. gives a purpose behind this sub (plant a tree to join the sub),. don't think growing trees on public land should be an issue but we need to do some level of terraforming, which might be an issue",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"criticism isn’t hate-but this is getting out of hand i’m from bengaluru, and honestly, i’m tired of seeing all the hate this city gets. no, it’s not perfect-traffic is insane, autos overcharge even for 2km, and dealing with some auto drivers is frustrating. but that doesn’t mean i hate the entire city.

lately, it feels like hating bengaluru has become a trend. non-kannadigas saying they feel treated differently-that’s valid. but even they end up saying “bengaluru this, bengaluru that…” even people born here say they hate the city.

i saw a post recently where someone said they hate bengaluru because a bmtc conductor was rude, and auto drivers judged them for how they dressed. i’m not saying that’s okay-those are real experiences. but isn’t that kind of judgment and rudeness present everywhere? isn’t that a societal problem, not a bengaluru-specific one?

now anything goes wrong, people blame the city: no water? hate bengaluru.
boss is rude? hate bengaluru.
underpaid? hate bengaluru.

yes, things need to improve. but instead of spreading hate online, why not focus on fixing what’s broken?",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"gba elections, our chance to change things.  maybe. on nov 1, 2025, the karnataka government will officially declare the creation of 368 wards within the greater bengaluru authority region.  this would probably be the final step before the government can decide on when to hold elections in bengaluru after almost a decade of not having elected representatives at the corporation level.  hopefully, the notification for elections would be done late this year or early next year.   

on paper, with more wards in each of the 5 corporations, it offers a chance of better governance.  even though the ward mapping was done against the 2011 census it still appears to be better than the previous mapping where some of the wards had grown beyond any control.  smaller ward areas offer citizens hope.  

if rwas, resident groups, colonies can come together and put pressure on parties to have good candidates, those with ethics, a vision, integrity, we could improve things on the ground. smaller wards also offer the chance for the communities to come together and put up their own candidates.  beyond caste, language, one among us could make a difference too in this scenario.  the second option would be their biggest nightmare.  all of us coming together can change our future. 

it's not an easy task and nothing will change overnight, but if we do not discuss and think about this in the coming weeks/months, we will end up here for the next few years complaining about roads, footpaths, garbage, transport, water, lakes and rivers among everything else. 

we have a lot of urban experts around, the iim, the iisc, are we tapping them enough to improve the situation in our city.  we can surely do better than a few kms of tender sure.  if we can build great roads and pavements around our airport, why can’t we extend them all over.    

corruption and inefficiencies must be addressed.  the bus stop shelters that keep coming up next to each other, the manhole that collapses every 2 months.  someone must own and address it for sure.  we want transparency, we cannot just submit requests to aros and keep visiting the offices several times until bribes are paid.  every request submitted to any official has to be tracked, every rupee spent by the govt on its citizens must be tracked and published.  we must come together, stop paying bribes and end corruption.  this is slowing our progress as a city and if not now, it's never. 

this is our chance to get the best candidates elected, ensure participation in ward committees and hold the officials accountable for their actions. 

we should also get out and vote, if you have lived here long enough, make sure that you have your name on the voters list.   50% voting percentages aren't good enough, we should push for the 80s at least if not more.  with smaller wards, the margin of victory could be in 100s.  so, let's ensure this happens too.   together, we can make the city more livable.   

let's start now.",PseudoTopic_0

metro phase three has been approved and is expected to take five years to complete. why does the government require so much time for these types of projects?
i don't understand. five years for just one metro project? how will we ever be able to complete other projects at this rate?
we won't be able to beat the traffic with this growth rate. in those five years, another batch of new people will move to the city, and the traffic problem will remain the same as it is today.
if we want to address the traffic issue, the government needs to work on public transportation infrastructure at a faster pace.
in countries like china, small projects like this are completed within a month. however, in india, everyone seems to want a percentage of the money. this slow development also leads to blocked roads and further traffic problems.",PseudoTopic_0

got a call from bbmp guy , asking name and where i live ,why did you complain about garbage being burnt in the group.

i told simply i put a pic about garbage being burnt openly , when lot of smoke is coming

he started hurling abuses , kept the phone in airplane mode , to avoid the conversation

bbmp guys are worse , with no proper plan to save bengaluru , they either dump in landfill / burn the garbage in large amounts , so surrounding air get's polluted.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"scr@w the culture of inviting 'busy' vips for events and competitions context: yesterday, i took our son for a ***“national level”*** yoga competition held at a large venue – the bbmp’s ‘rajkumar glass house’ in central bengaluru. the announcement said registration by 8.30 and we were there at the venue by then. several school busses with a few hundred of kids, teachers and guardians had also turned up. 

there were about 8-10 ‘event organizers’ in coats and sherwanis milling around and one (introduced himself as an “ex kas officer” took to the mike to talk to fill the void. 

after an hour of waiting, i went over to one of the guys in nehru coat to ask about the delay – he said they were expecting “some vips” to inaugurate who. 

after waiting for another hour the guys came back on stage and finally at 11 am, decided to ‘light the lamp.’

the same guy (ex-kas) took to the podium and said they had been waiting for the mp of central bengaluru who “had a last-minute election appointment” and another vip – an ias officer and one of the divisional commissioners of bbmp who couldn’t make it. 

the guys who had been milling around took turns for another half-hour talking about nothing to “officially inaugurate the event”

the event that was supposed to start at 8.30 started at 12 pm … by then the kids who had been told to skip breakfast before doing yoga were hungry and restless.

this really tested my patience and i decided to walk out at 12 with our disappointed son!

reddit,"gt road route hi,

does any one know what the real/exact route of gt road is in uttar pradesh?
the literature on internet says it goes through kanpur, then via agra to delhi.

but i live in kanpur and called the highway like road going like 200 m from our home, the gt road since childhood. it's also designated so in google maps.

the problem is: i live on the north west part of kanpur and the highway makes the turn to southwest to agra via auraiya much southeast of our home. the highway near our home leads to kannauj. and as per internet, there seems to be gt road in kannuaj. that also seems true in google maps.

does the gt road goes through kannauj? if yes, then why do all the maps of gt road on internet show the route making a southwest turn from kanpur and not kannauj? and kannuaj is also not mentioned anywhere in the literature about gt road, so why there is a gt road in kannauj?

it is very confusing. i will appreciate anyone clearing this all up.

thanks",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"quality of engineering colleges in bengaluru and churning graduates  well bengaluru and southern counter parts are producing more engineers than the actual demand , and we're seeing the effects post pandemic , while some skilled students figure out what they want to do earlier and join internships in second/ third year itself (private deemed univ.) , state run university students are still stuck even when the final year is approaching

most of the core branch tier 3 students like electrical/mechanical/civil have been letting go of their own branch , and join jspider's / qspiders for some full stack or testing courses ,the demand has severely gone down. most of the electrical branch in my college 70-80% students were jobless graduated fall 2022 ,  it was non-autonomous.

electrical students aren't even aware of vlsi as a career path . vtu also is very poor and outdated in it's curriculum and doesn't even match the current standards , in this fast paced ai automation world were cost cutting is the trend and saving jobs have been literally a challenging task 70hrs work etc , and when they think about it they are already graduated

i would want to know what's the situation in autonomous colleges , are they giving you a good level playing field , so you're industry ready?

edit : so what's the future, some are doing food business and there are rare people who start a tech company , that can scale up",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"few questions regarding cooking rice. so i am a virgin when it comes to cooking rice, but i think the time has come to finally lose it. i bought an electric rice cooker recently, and although the instructions are clear in the manual, i have few stuff i wanna know before it becomes a bad first time experience for me.

i will be cooking some kind of basmati rice.

1. some people have said that the rice should be soaked before cooking. if yes, then for how long?  
2. also, should i add salt to the water? during cooking phase or soaking phase(if soaking is required at all)  
3. which type of rice should i be using for regular use? the one i bought seems to be little bit costly. which should be fine, saw some cheaper ones as well, but definitely would prefer some better quality ones.  
4. how many grams of uncooked rice should i put in for 1 person? (would be eating it with dal and some vegetables/curries)  


thanks!",PseudoTopic_0
reddit,"how much extreme our temperature needs to get before people start to die on the streets ? today at about 2.10 pm i rescued a swiggy delivery person who fainted and fell from his bike due to dehydration near vakola in mumbai. i picked him up from the ground and brought electral for him from the nearby chemist who assisted me to bring ice and cold water too. luckily he was not injured because he was yet to start his bike. this happened when he came back after fulfilling a delivery nearby.

i thought pretty much our whole country has a similar problem of high temperatures. god knows how many people have to face this ? the swiggy boy was just 21 years old. i was out on the street from my office for hardly 5 minutes and i got drenched in sweat and these riders do this the whole day. can't imagine what the future of our country is ? 

is it likely extreme climate changes and heat waves may just straight up kill people ? i cannot stand outside my office in the day for more than 10 mins. i have been to delhi, bangalore and goa too and the summers are not that different there as well. much worse in delhi.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"why do contractors, handymen, laborers, etc. show up with no tools? i am a foreigner who has lived india (mumbai) for several years now. i have wondered why professionals i hire, for example, from urban company show jobs show up with no tools? considering i am a big diy person and hobbyist, i have many tools to lend them so it never is a problem, but it makes me wonder what would happen should another one of their clients does not have tools.

for example: 

when we need a water pump fixed, they ask for pliers, a pipe wrench and geiser hoses. 

when we needed some underground pipes fixed, they needed a pick axes and a hoe (we have a small garden)

we had a bee hive removed from a tree and they needed a knife, a bucket, some newspaper and a lighter. 

we had some light fixtures repaired and they needed a plaster saw, spare wires and lightbulbs.

its not so annoying as it is just interesting and weird to me. it would be very strange in the us to show up at a home with nothing but yourself, lol. can they not afford some basic tools from local hardware shops or mr. diy? can anyone tell me why it is this way in india?

reddit,"a linkedin post which made me sad! “i travelled last night from bangalore international airport ltd via a #bmtc #vayuvajra #volvo bus.

i was the only female in the bus apart from 5 other male passengers, the driver and the conductor.

the conductor cheated me 50 rupees saying, change illa, madam.

there were 5 other guys, who were staring at me continuously. they were discussing something in their mother tongue about me. they were drinking whiskey from paper box.

i got down at koramangala around 1:30 am. the drunkard gang  alighted with me and started following me. i asked siri, 5 drunkards following me, what shall i do?

siri: run as if your life depends on it.

i started running, but the gang caught up with me quickly.

i asked siri, the drunkards are catching up, what shall i do?

siri: run faster and whoever catches you first, pepper spray him

i run faster, one slim guy caught up with me, i took out pepper spray from my vanity bag and sprayed it on his face. nothing happened to him, his gang caught me quickly.

i yelled at siri, the gang caught up again, what shall i do now?

siri: take off mask and sneeze on them loudly and tell that you are corona positive

i took off my double mask and sneezed on them and said i was corona positive.

the gang panicked and switched off their mobile phone, they had gau rogya setu app installed, which will flag them in close contact with corona positive case.

bbmp, police, gau rogya setu gang, rt pcr test gang would  make their life hell.

they yelled, bhago madarc\*\*do, agar gau rogya setu app, hamara status red dikhaya, to kal hume bhuka rehna padega, koi kaam nahi dega. bbmp wale, police wale, rt pcr test wale sab hamara pichhe pad jayega,

the gang run away as if they saw a ghost. cool breeze was blowing in my face, i was shivering. sir chaddichandan's smiling face was displayed in a bill board, in the same board their was photo of ajay devagan telling, ""setu aap ka suraksha chakra"".

i thanked gau rogya setu app and bowed down to sir chaddichandan for tracking everyone and saving my dignity.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"does congress manifesto for 2024 delivers well on people's expectations or it's missing something? reading through congress manifesto feels like it covers most of the commonly talked about issues with  promises to deliver upon them like social equity, youth, women, farmer, worker, constitution, economy, federalism, national security and environment. there are promises of new laws, amendments, monitory benefits, job creation etc. overall many would relate to the issues identified. though how piece could be addressed with some details as many of these promises are projected as wishes and intentions (subjective opinion) which will raise genuine questions around viability. especially when some of these promises looks like huge financial undertaking on any govt's part.

there is a good amount of focus on bjp too, in fact almost every section starts with a run down on bjp. 

surprised to not find anything related to space tech. less to none about high tech, innovation, road safety,  assessment of representatives, accountability- though there is a mention of reprimanding them if they leave a party. just one line to strengthen a program on air pollution which is a huge problem now.

what are your thought? does it appeal to you or you find it missing some key elements?",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"my ex, love of my life, filed false sexual harassment charges. i came out clean. what action can i take when nobody seems to care?
 people of bangalore, brace yourselves for millennial drama! tl;dr in the end

hello everyone! 4 years ago, my then live-in partner, filed a false sexual harassment case on me which made me run pillar to post in courts for all these years, only to see her not show up to the court at all. finally, after four proclamations and an nbw, she shows up only to turn hostile in the box and deny her complaint. my spirit crushed right there. here's how the story goes;

i am a native bangalorean. the two of us fell in love when i was 21 and she was 19. our relationship went on for two years before our parents found out. by then i had already materialised my brain-child of a start-up. so when confronted, my parents threatened to throw me out of the house if i chose her over them. me being the righteous kind, said it wasn't fair on her, and obliged. at a very young age, i learnt how it feels to be dejected by your own. to make matters worse, they even had a tiff with the girl's side over the same. succumbing to parental pressure, even the girl left her home (i wasn't notified, her eloping came out of the blue to me)

because i already had a business up and running, i accepted her decision but we chose to live separately. she assisted me with client communication while i closed the deals and worked on projects. a year down the line, we moved into a flat, started living-in together. that's when the problems arose. she often kept stirring up inconducive conversations about how my parents had behaved with hers and how they were disturbed   and all. i kept telling her that what was important was that i was with her, away from my parents. but it gradually became a huge concern and things only went downhill then on. while i had no qualms with her going to meet her people, she made sure that i didn't reconcile with mine. she would often resort to self-sabotaging, slicing up her arm and whatnot whenever we had an argument. while i spoke as a team, she always considered me as an opponent in an argument.

one unfortunate day, i came back home only to see her pull off a gone girl. poof! she was gone. what more, she had eloped with every single document that ever mattered to my existence. starting from my bank cards to company documents to personal documents to vehicle documents to even the house key! 

not only had i lost the one person who i fought the world for, i also had nothing to go on with. four days later i learnt from her friend that she had been suggesting my girl to leave me for over a year, because she thought i wasn't the right match! not only did she not return my stuff but also tried to get an equal share from my bank account because we were living-in. 

i was depressed, shut myself in, didn't even let my parents know, when all the while she had comfortably returned to her home. seeing my condition deteriorate, my friends themselves informed my parents and they were once again back in my life.

after failed pleas for a decent parting for over a month, i had to file a complaint in my local police station about my missing items. the cop was very kind to help me out with such a trivial matter. he fetched her location and sent me to retrieve my stuff only for me to realise that she had returned to her parents' native. i alone had to riskingly enter a village where i knew everybody would be hostile. it's a miracle i even made it out safe. the woman didn't budge. she kept saying everything was rightfully hers. had to return empty handed because dare i not confront a 'woman' amongst her own people. 

two days later, the cop stepped his foot down and asked her to come down to the station along with her family. once there, instead of responding to my complaint, she creates a hue and cry about how she's an equal shareholder and deserved to get half of my bank balance because we were in a live-in relationship. i held my ground but a few cop subordinates coerced me saying that i better give away the money otherwise she could very well press rape charges against me. i had no words. i was coerced into writing a cheque, only for me to realise that she along with her friend had forged up false documents to make the claim. 

me being the righteous kind, said it wasn't done, and blocked the cheque (mind you, i blocked the cheque while maintaining sufficient balance). 

a month later, she slammed me with a cheque bounce case, alleging that cheque bounced due to insufficient funds. i couldn't care less. 

i appeared before the court and pleaded not guilty, said i'd fight it out. 

her family and herself couldn't stand it at all. parallely, they had to account for a random guy showing up at their native and also about her disappearance for two years. us being from the same locality, they went around saying how i had married her and cheated on her, treated her the worst bla bla bla, and that they were gonna send me to prison. 

which they did, a month later. but never did they reveal to people on what charges and what case.

here's how the fir went: 

that she and i had met four years ago in some annual meet and that i had been persistently behind her since then, stalking her and forcing her to 'love me, love me'. and one fine day, i lost my shit, followed her, pulled her dupatta, outraged her modesty (a foolish attempt at bringing in ipc 354, 354a charges) and threatened her to love me or else i'd kill her entire family (ipc 506 😂ik). 

the joke of it all? i wasn't even in bangalore on the said day!!! 

here's a woman who in the beginning of the relationship had absolutely no hesitation to lie to me for sympathy points about how she was sexually abused and molested as a child!!! (women of reddit, please chime in as to whether anything can justify this!! i was too blind in love to overlook this, and had instead chosen to let go), and now she was lying through her teeth that i myself had tried to  harass her sexually.

because she was a woman and brought in some influence, the police not only registered the complaint but also filed the fir without any investigation. i was arrested in the night, wasn't told why, was kept in the cell overnight, was taken to the court next day. despite it being a non-bailable offence (14-day remand a mandate), the judge saw through the truth of the matter instantly but a.p had gone home by then, it was 5pm. unfortunately, i had to go to prison for one night (don't ask me how i came out sane. after what i saw inside, i doubt very few men can), was bailed out the next day. to my dismay, the police filed chargesheet with the only evidence in it being her statement along with her family's.

cut to four years later, after countless sessions with my lawyers and in court, my fighting spirit had worn off. but since truths were by my side, although delayed, justice arrived. in both cases. 

i had come out clean from both the false charges (the cheque bounce and the sexual harrasment). the orders in the first stated she had miserably failed to make her case and that she had produced questionable evidences. in the second, the orders stated that she denied me ever outraging her modesty and that the incident never happened. 

finally, after four years (covid to top it off, business had fallen faceflat), i walked out of the court, spirit battered and bruised, but soul at peace, at last. 

my battles are over, now is my time to salvage my life. there's absolutely no incentive for me to go back to the mess again. but me being the eccentric righteous kind, just can't get the matter out of my head. 

i cannot digest the fact that an individual can bring one's life to shambles with their malicious lies, all because they're from a particular gender/group. i'm not making this a man v/s woman issue. i'm making it a truth v/s lies issue. no lie should be able to reign supreme, no matter the difference is in gender, race, class, creed, age etc. 

i cannot stand the fact that a lie could be so loud and destructive whereas my truth when came out, came out in silence. the court acquittal orders were issued at around 3pm by a clerk in an empty court room, judge wasn't even around. atrocities of the lies were loud, but my truth was barely a whimper.

i've always believed that human suffering should amount to a difference in ways of the world. if one has suffered, he must strive to ensure someone else doesn't face the same fate. if suffering goes unquestioned, then really, what is the point of it all? of this society? 

with these thoughts in mind, i consulted my lawyers and i wanted to press more than civil defamation charges. i wanted to press criminal charges because it is a criminal offence to file false firs, commit fraud and present false witnesses. my acquittal orders are already foolproof evidence to all these crimes. 


yet, yet....i have zero support. parents brushed aside my rebuttal saying that i better not get into it again since she can come up with any cock-and-bull story. i can't even begin to explain to them how irrational their fear is. i didn't relent. said i would take action myself with or without their help. finally, they gave in, said that they'd press charges on my behalf as my parents and that i focus on my future.

believing them, i moved to a new city for work and resumed my life. now, suddenly, they're singing a different tune. that they're too old to be taking all this stress, that they tell it for my own food, and that i should let it go too.

i cannot even!!!!! now, i'm stuck in a different city, with all the trauma, and all alone! if i wanna go back and take up the matter myself, i'll jeopardize my work, and i can't trust my parents to ever stand for me. 

so here i am, desolated from my homeland, dejected by my own, and destroyed by the only person i ever chose to love the most. 

what respite do i have? what action can i take? i'm no johnny depp, why would the world care when my own parents didn't? how can i, being thousands of miles away, even start to take legal action over this? 

it's actually super easy and convenient for me to put it all behind, but i simply cannot. if my own well-to-do parents would rather disown me again than stand by me just because it's a woman on the other end, what hope does any average man in india have? what hope does truth have over lies?

i need help. so that with my voice, i can help to ensure no other soul succumbs to malice in this deceitful world. that one day, i can fearlessly call out my perpetrator and encourage others to do the same.

humans of reddit, i appeal to you. please help! 

tl;dr - i left my parents for my love. 
              my love left me for her parents.
              her parents abetted her in framing me with false charges. 
i came out clean.
now my parents will neither let me fight the lie nor will they help me fight the lie. 

and i cannot let my suffering go pointless, since things really need to change in this country. old outdated laws must have no place. no woman should have unquestioned power to indict a man where he has no say. help!",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"from september 1, power will be disconnected if bills are not paid: bescom the bangalore electricity supply company on friday [said](https://www.deccanherald.com/india/karnataka/bengaluru/from-september-1-power-will-be-disconnected-if-bills-are-not-paid-state-owned-firm-bescom-3171050) that from september 1, if consumers fail to pay electricity charges within 30 days of receiving bills or do not pay the required additional security deposit, it would disconnect their power supply.

a period of 15 days is provided for electricity bill payments until the due date without interest, the power company said, adding that an additional 15-day grace period is available for payments with interest after the due date. ""however, if the bill remains unpaid, the electricity supply will be disconnected on the next meter reading day."" bescom said.

currently, defaulters get much more than 30 days to pay outstanding bills. from sep 1, if bills are not paid within 30 days, power supply will be disconnected.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"bengaluru has grown beyond its geographical and sustainable limits. karnataka's other cities have missed the development bus completely in the north, bengaluru has almost touched with nelamnagala and dabaspete. chikkaballapur is not far. devanahalli is now part of bengaluru. down south, bengaluru has transcended bidadi so much so that atleast 30 kms of mysore road is still within the city. on the other side, ecity has touched hosur in tn and kr puram has eaten into omr raring to go near hoskote.



both on a geographical and a sustainable scale, bengaluru has been squeezed. such unchecked growth coupled with haphazard development is a recipe for real estate exploitation, improper infrastructure and eventually the lowering of the brand bengaluru. in its penchant to make the bengaluru the hub, successive governments across all parties have ignored other good cities.



mysore/mandya : this gets little bit of development pie only because of the jds connection and political bigwigs from this region. but the pie is too less compared to what bengaluru has. credit to the politicians from this region for throwing weight for the regions they come from.



belgaum (not to be confused with belgium 😅) : beyond the grand posturing of construction a winter holiday resort for mlas (read suvarna soudha), the so called/so dubbed 'second capital' of karnataka is completely ignored. this city got its first indian constructed railway flyover after 75 years!! so much for the second capital!! it has one of the biggest foundry clusters in india but our state government ignores it. 



hubli/dharwad :  this city perhaps has the best potential of being a economy compatriot in the northern karnataka but unfortunately it has been ignored as well. just read the number of politicians from this region going onto become chief ministers, and union ministers but the politiccians have essentially used the people of this twin cities as a platform and then completely ignored them!!! brts and a failed techpark is all the development happening. telco, marco polo and other ssi have been ignored. the hubli-dharward-belagavi are also nearer to ports than bangalore and are nearer to mumbai as well. however such straetgic location has not been exploited. 



mangalore : the first thing that comes to mind when i hear mangalore is tourism and nit surathkal! nothing more than that. nothing pains when you see a port city in the important west coast of india being ignored. look at how gujarat capitalized on the port city of surat and they don't even have sea directly just tapi river



gulbarga/bellary : with thermal plants and a gateway to the steel and manuf hubs in central india, gbl (kalburgi) and bellary had it all going. but except the reddy brothers and blistering heat, i see no real development in these regions compared to bengaluru. 



karnataka cannot just piggyback on the bengaluru bubble and boast development. karnataka has the highest population density deficit between capital city and other cities. for all the people in this sub from others parts of india coming here, perhaps you are unaware, all youths from all parts of karnataka just run towards bengaluru because there are very few and non-existent employment opportunities in their own cities/towns. more than half of my friends/contacts hailing from other cities in karnataka are in bengaluru. this is only adding to the problem rather than fuel development.



if any of you guys here new to bengaluru/karnataka, do travel beyond the bengaluru-mysore belt.. you will notice such stark difference in terms of infrastructure and development. the slogan of karnataka tourism is one state - many worlds. its rather true because it's one state - two contrasting worlds. one of bengaluru and the other of rest of karnataka.


it is time to look beyond bengaluru. 
in the 2000s we used to see this quote plastered all over by the infamous arindam chaudhuri - ""dare to think beyond the iims"". i hope the state government dares to see beying the bengalurus.



p.s : it took me 55 minutes to reach whitefield to marathahalli last week. i could circumvent the complete  city of second capital of karnataka in the same time - twice!",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"why are we normalizing corruption in bengaluru? what is ideal is having few corruptions in some projects and 90% non-corrupt ones, and the corrupt should always be afraid that they will be caught.

what used to happen in bengaluru is that 10% of projects are without corruption, and 90% have some sort of corruption. apart from politicians and bureaucrats—aren’t we responsible for letting it happen?

you see it everywhere—bellandur metro is still not ready, even after 5–6 years. china would have built it in 6 months. doesn’t that smell like corruption? thousands of lakes have disappeared—everyone is silent. there is a permanent loss to bengaluru. it is an unpardonable offense because it killed the water supply not just for you, but also your son, daughter—their children—and it goes on. inflation is shooting through the roof. those in it are doing fine, but those who lost their jobs, in other fields or as helpers, have blood in their tears.

for bengaluru, there is rampant anarchy—it has been happening for 20 years. in my hometown, every year i visit, there is a new flyover. in bengaluru, there is nothing. a city of global importance is buried under a thick sheet of corruption where everything is delayed. forget the roads—we don’t even show it on social media. the whole fight happens over language, insider-outsider debates, but the termites eating our city are invisible to them. why don’t we—all of bengaluru—stand against corrupt practices? we idiots don’t even transfer our voter id. yes, i call those people idiots. where you live right now is your responsibility.

people are spending 3–3.5 hours in travel, in one of the richest cities in india! this is not acceptable. how much will you tolerate? right under your nose, bike taxis are banned for no reason, causing trouble to lakhs of techies! you and i are facing problems daily now! i am shocked that we don’t respond! the media doesn’t cover it. opposition parties are totally silent. who is standing for us?

we are not united. unless something kills us, we stay quiet. then fine—tomorrow, it will! why are newspapers and media silent over decades of corruption in bengaluru? there should be a limit. isn’t it?",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"need serious help regarding business in india vs work abroad hey. i am 22 years old and i come from a middle class family, did my engineering in computer science from a tier 2 clg and got placed in a good mnc with a decent package. right from my fourth year of engineering i started planning how i need to lead my life going ahead and realised that i have a good potential to become an entrepreneur. i have been a dynamic individual, a hustler and someone driven by purpose. i don't know how to explain but i feel i have that ability to stay longer with the problems and make anything possible.

during my planning stage, one thing when i was zeroing down on entrepreneurship that was constantly bothering me was the 'quality of life' in india. i stay in bangalore and where do i start? right from the dusty air, lack of civic sense, pollution, lack of cleanliness, terrible traffic and it's basically adjustment in everything. you want to go out with your frnds, be ready to battle the maniacs in the traffic, wait everywhere and torture yourself in the potholes, thanks to the poor infrastructure.

i then started thinking if it's even worth it to start a business in india, like sure you can get rich and all that is there but what's the point when you don't have clean air to breathe, no peace of mind and you are always struggling for basic needs such as the above. basically compromising on the quality of life.

so i started questioning my decision and was thinking of an alternative where in i can take an l1 transfer to u.s.a. from my company by involving a lot more in other projects and living to the true motto of my life 'max out your potential, regardless of whatever you are doing'. but i am not able to come to terms with the fact that i won't be an entrepreneur when i had that capability and instead i'm choosing this path which definitely eliminates all the above problems, but still you know deep down i might question myself why i didn't go all in when i had tht capability.

how do i get out of this rut? pls give me your advice/feedback regarding this.

thanks a lot for your time :)",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"my foreign friends experienced rural indian hospitality and it left them genuinely astonished so i did my ms in the west, made a bunch of great friends there, and once in a while they visit india. but like most foreigners, they stick to the big cities, monuments, tourist magnets, instagram places, you know the drill.

this time i told them:

&gt; “bro, keep taj mahal aside. i’m taking you to real india.”


so me, a few local buddies, and my foreign friends rented a traveller and went on a road trip straight into rural india, my home turf. i wanted to show them the actual heartbeat of the country: villages, farms, tiny temples, little gems that many people doesn’t even know exist.

they were already surprised just seeing how connected village people are

when i took them to my own village, they were absolutely stunned that i knew literally every person by name and their father’s nameand sometimes their grandfather’s name.

everywhere we went it was like:

&gt; “oh this is so-and-so’s son, whose father is so-and-so…”



my friends were confused like:

&gt; “how do you people remember this?!”



then came the bad event, our traveller broke down at dusk

mechanic came, tried his best, but nope. it was getting dark. no hotels. proper rural area. options were:

1. sleep in the traveller
2. or somehow find shelter

then my village instincts activated. 

my mom told me there’s a woman from our village living in the next village with her husband. so me and a friend started walking there, asking around for her by name.

classic village style:

&gt; “do you know x’s daughter who married y from this village?”


and somehow, within a few minutes, we reached her house.

we explained the situation to her husband. without a single question he said:

&gt; “stay here tonight.”


then we told him the real number:

&gt; “uh… there are 12 of us.”


he didn’t even blink.
he instantly called neighbours, friends and within 5 minutes they arranged sleeping space, bedding, and food for all 12 of us.

no charge.
no formalities.
no hesitation.
just pure humanity.

and here’s the best part:
they didn’t even know yet that some of us were foreigners.

when they saw the foreigners… party mode on 😂

suddenly everyone came with chai, snacks, dinner, stories, jokes — it turned into a mini village festival. people kept saying:

&gt; “guest is god.” (“athithi devo bhava” )


my foreign friends were floored. they were shocked with the hospitality we received.

one literally said:

&gt; “in the west, not even your neighbour will let you stay in their house, forget a complete stranger.”


honestly, this is just normal village culture for us

growing up, i’ve slept at my friends’ houses so many times. i would fall asleep while playing, and instead of waking me up, they’d cover me with a bedsheet and put me on a proper bed. my parents never panicked, they knew i was safe because everyone in the village looks after each other.

during weddings, guests stayed at random houses. no need to book hotels, you just find someone from your village, district, or even the same state, and boom you're family.

my grandfather was legendary at this. he had a crazy good memory and would make connections instantly:

&gt; “this person is related to that person who knows that person from the neighbouring village.”


because of him, we built friendships everywhere. and whenever a problem came up, someone always helped because of those village connections.

my foreign friends said it was the most heartwarming experience of their lives.

and i honestly felt proud.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"the one truth that can explain everything wrong with india. i saw a journalist on twitter post a video of a man carrying his dead wife on his shoulder, exiting a hospital and marching his way home quite a distance away. the journalist mentioned in his caption how there’s no dignity in death, and there’s no ambulance or vehicle to carry the body home.

however, i saw nothing wrong in it. this journalist was speaking with a strange expectation, something i call, “big city standards.” people in much of india have been living this way for hundreds of years. doesn’t he realize that?

all of the problems that us big city folk feel, can be attributed to a misplaced expectation of 21st century modern city standards on a country that is still largely pre industrial, living in the agricultural age, and even in the agricultural age, much of india still lives with back breaking field work in sweltering heat using primitive tools.

let me remind you all that only 30% of india lives in cities with some semblance of 21st century life. 70% of india lives in the pre industrial age, with lives comparable to pre wwi era. they might have cellphone connectivity and mobile phones, but their lives have largely not changed in the past hundred years, not by much anyway.

i see lot of indians complaining on the lack of civic sense amongst indians. a lot of indians, even city dwellers do not know how to use a western cubicle to do their business. we see on gutka stains on the walls of public buildings or walls. we see garbage thrown on the streets (garbage segregation?! what’s that?). open defecation is still a thing. poor driving discipline. all of this is to be blamed on us not reaching the 21st century yet. we are hundreds of years behind. 

social change in the west, with movements such as feminism, human rights and equality rode on the back economic improvements powered by the industrial revolution. people in india either forget, or are simply not aware that india has not yet reached 21st century levels of industrialization. so even, socially, we remain a backward country with poor regard for women’s rights or human rights.

even our democracy hasn’t reached 21st century standards because of this reason. we have a gdp per capita around the 2000$ range, with 800 million dependent on govt ration to feed themselves. putting people behind bars without a trial, and keeping them there for years is totally okay with the morals of  70% rural population and a big chunk of city dwellers are immigrants from rural areas. not tolerating criticism and always having your sentiments hurt is also a symptom of being an underdeveloped nation. just look at the way the laws are framed in this country, it resembles less like a developed democratic country and more similar to some autocratic regime. free speech is a joke in this country. innocent until proven guilty is a joke in the country. justice delivery is a joke. indian police procedure is a joke!

the indian middle class which has slogged all its life studying for competitive exams and lives in broken cities with falling bridges, airports and hoardings, while traversing through flooded and pot hole infested roads basically does government charity for 5-6 months of a year. majority of tax is generated by them in these cities and all of that goes in subsidizing the lives of farmers and rural folk who don’t know what modern farming is, stubbornly refuse to listen to learned minds and are a perennial loss making venture, and default on all their loans only for the govt to waive it off, all at the expense of the taxpayer. they resist any kind of farm reform, and their resistance is violent sometimes, and keep increasing their demands for subsidies and keep demanding the govt buy their shitty produce at a price that they set with no regard for market forces. some idealistic middle class city dwellers call them “annadattas” and support them but they’re so brain dead cos they don’t realize that the failure of farmers to adopt modern farming is making their lives more expensive cos the govt has to extract the money from somewhere and it just so happens that the middle class is the most dependable cash cow.

the politicians can’t do much no matter who it is, because they’ve to cater to 70% ignorant, uneducated people from the 17th century. not to mention staggering levels of corruption at all levels of industry and government. i expect nothing more from a 2000$ gdp per capita country. 

if you realize this one truth about india, you will pack your bags and make for greener pastures. cos ain’t nobody got hundreds of years to wait for india to become developed. btw, it is getting harder and harder to move to a developed country. while we still live in agricultural age, with primitive tools, developed countries are moving to the artificial intelligence age. 


tldr ; india is a pre industrial primitive agricultural country. it is improper to expect 21st century standards of life from a country where huge populations live like it’s the 17th century. the dignity of life, civic sense, consciousness of democratic rights, freedom of speech, fair justice system, humane police procedures etc are too utopian for common indian to access. it’ll take hundreds, if not thousands of years to achieve current western standards of life, dignity and democracy. those who can leave, should leave for greener pastures.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"the coerced electricity tax on chennai vaasis: ups, batteries, inverters, and stabilizers becoming  everybody expense there’s an unspoken tax every chennaiite pays—not printed on a bill, not legislated by the state, yet unavoidable. it’s the tax of survival in a city where electricity reliability has collapsed under tneb’s monopoly. every citizen is now a reluctant participant in a silent infrastructure project that exists only because the tamil nadu electricity board has failed to deliver the stability it’s supposed to guarantee.

what used to be public responsibility is now a private burden. homes that once needed only a simple plug point now resemble power management rooms. there are ups units tucked under tables, inverters stacked in corners, stabilizers lined up behind almost every appliance, and separate ups units keeping wi‑fi routers alive through outages. residential space, already scarce in chennai’s dense apartments, is now sacrificed to store bulky batteries and service gear that shouldn’t even be necessary.

the financial load is staggering. families spend anywhere between ₹15,000 and ₹60,000 on this makeshift ecosystem—then pay for maintenance every year: topping battery water, replacing dead cells, rewiring burned sockets, and booking technician visits that add both direct cost and wasted time. every few years, the replacement cycle begins again. delivery charges for batteries, wall reinforcements for inverters, and transportation costs pile up quietly into a parallel economy built on voltage instability.

and the absurdity doesn’t end there. the very power fluctuations that destroy appliances also damage the backup gear meant to protect them, creating a self‑fueling loop of expense. these devices were conceived as solutions for emergencies, yet under tneb’s neglect, they’ve become mandatory equipment for every home—from low‑income tenants to it professionals. the city’s residents are essentially running a personal energy ecosystem under the nose of a state monopoly.

tneb, meanwhile, continues to operate unchecked. complaints about erratic voltage, sudden outages during peak heat, or unplanned maintenance blackouts rarely see quick resolution. the organization still dictates supply, pricing, and service quality—without competition, incentive, or accountability. citizens shoulder the cost while the board remains insulated from consequence.

chennai’s collective energy spend now includes two layers: the official tariff paid to tneb and the silent, coerced tax of backup infrastructure—paid in cash, square footage, maintenance fatigue, and lost trust.

this system has persisted so long that it’s become invisible. yet it’s time we ask a fundamental question:

is tneb’s monopoly on power distribution truly in the public interest, or has it evolved into a state‑sanctioned stranglehold that forces every chennai vaasi to pay for self‑sufficiency within their own homes?

how different or similar is the situation in your city ?",PseudoTopic_0

i get why the new people complain also being part of the problem(including me). i just wish they could see what bangalore used to be but not possible now i guess.

reddit,"bbmp strike and hooliganism congrats to the set of hooligans who decided to dump garbage in front of my house in the name of ""strike"". my road literally stinks now.

long story short, the garbage collector comes as per usual and is picking up garbage from everyone. around 20 people appear suddenly in 2 wheelers and start making a lot of noise.

apparently there's a strike going on and the man was ignoring the strike by doing his work. these hooligans then proceed to physicially assault said man, nearly upend his garbage van and successfully dump all the garbage in front of my house. they proceed to move his now empty van physically and get out of there.

shoutout to the person who was doing his job and did his utmost to make sure that the garbage wasn't dumped there (of course, he nearly got beaten up for this). hope he's safe from these hooligans.

tl;dr - garbage man gets nearly assaulted and is forced to dump all the garbage he had collected in front of house, thanks to the strike.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"i'm stuck in bams has anyone actually managed to escape this trap?

i failed in neet and ended up in bams.yes,i was unaware of this quackery before.the more i read it i realize its limitations,pseudoscience and even straight up misogyny...

fundamentals of ayurveda &gt;&gt;

dosha (vata,pitta,kapha) – basically india’s version of the discarded humoral theory,which can't be measured or seen but if they're vitiated in body they cause disease even if its cancer,fever..tuberculosis etc..

dhatu (rasa &gt; rakta(blood)&gt;mamsa(muscle) &gt;meda(fat)&gt;asthi(bones) &gt;majja &gt;shukra (semen)
means preceding one forms the next🙂).

agni , it's a some invisible body fire that’s supposed to control all metabolism.
cramming shlokas like we are supposed to chant in front of patients and cure them 🤡

acharyas contradicting each other in the texts, instead of a single evidence based conclusion.you all know popular contradiction in ayurveda 360 bones and modern 206 but there are many such things(like around 20 types of fever are mentioned in ayurveda and one type is actually caused by bhoot,pret,using beautiful women for tuberculosis treatment while maintaining celibacy etc.i have to write my own samhita with the title ""flaws of sushrutha/charaka samhita🤡 ) but we actually need to cram for exams to memorize the stupidity of acharyas i guess and many bs theories present in it said by our proffesors themselves.

yet we’re told to mug it all up, as if rote learning will suddenly make pseudoscience into science.even if you know what you're studying is bs,nothing we can do 

last month was my birthday. my parents came to meet me,i broke down completely. i cried in front of them and asked to be taken to a psychiatrist because i couldn’t handle this course anymore.

psychiatrist  first said: just discontinue the course and pursue something else.  i thought someone finally understood me.

but then my father said: he’s not talking properly these days...the psychiatrist just started defending ayurveda like

“allopathy has so many side effects.”
ayurveda is 100% natural."" 
( just because side effects aren’t discovered doesn’t mean they don’t exist).

“what your mother gives as kashaya is ayurveda. every coconut, groundnut oil, every home remedy that’s ayurveda.”


like… wtf food and water are they also ayurveda?and if side effects aren’t even studied properly, how is that a defense?
after all these he said ""idk about ayurveda but you should study instead of making these excuses""

he ended by prescribing escitalopram and telling me to “study well, you’re troubling your parents.”i didn't say anything...this  depressed me further

two mbbs students sitting there also added: “first year is always tough, later it’ll be fine.” as if one day the concepts of dosha, dhatu, agni, and atma will magically turn into modern pharmacology.

it became the worst day of my life even tried of sui*cide who's gonna explain them.


i keep dragging myself through this course, but every day i feel more hopeless. my parents want me to “practice ayurveda” after this, but i cannot imagine wasting 5.5 years of my life cramming shlokas and pushing treatments that even science has rejected.


i know i'm dumb and delusional but at least not that to belive in our body and universe made of akasha,vayu,agni,jala,prithvi and there is no fire sitting inside stomach and our body is much complicated than 3 dosha...

don’t know what my future looks like anymore.i have no one to share my problems all my friends are brainwased and try to brainwash me too also parents think that its gold mine next to mbbs and i no longer have faith in so called god.i just needed to write this all out...i can't bear this guilt for 5.5years",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"middle-class taxpayers in india get nothing – struggling with my mom’s cancer treatment at aiims i never thought i’d be in this position—running around hospitals, waiting in endless queues, dealing with rude staff, and watching my mom suffer, all while feeling completely helpless. but here we are.

my mom has breast cancer, and after 40 exhausting days of waitings and follow ups, she finally got her first chemo at aiims. but this is just the beginning. we still have at least six more chemo cycles, one major surgery, one full course of radiation, and countless follow-ups ahead. i don’t know how we’ll survive this.

💔 the reality of being middle class in india

we are a middle-class family in odisha. my father is a government employee with a limited income, and we never thought we’d be in a situation like this.

the bsky card (biju swasthya kalyan yojana) provides ₹5-7 lakh per year for non-taxpayers, allowing them to get private hospital treatment. meanwhile, we, the taxpayers, are left to rot in government hospitals where:
✔️ appointments take months.
✔️ security guards and hospital staff treat you like garbage.
✔️ you’re just another number in a never-ending queue.

i see people getting faster, better treatment at private hospitals with their bsky cards, while we—who contribute to the system—are stuck navigating a nightmare of bureaucracy, exhaustion, and inhumane treatment.

the doctors at aiims are great, but reaching them is a battle. i feel like i spend more time standing in lines, begging for updates, and filling out paperwork than actually taking care of my mom.

🩺 the aiims treatment nightmare

the experience at aiims has been nothing short of exhausting. the process is painfully slow, and the system is broken. patients who are already weak from their illness have to wait hours just to get basic procedures done. appointments take weeks, sometimes months. there’s no proper communication, and it feels like no one cares about the suffering of patients or their families.

the worst part is the inhuman behavior of the security and hospital staff. they talk to people as if they are objects, shouting at patients, pushing them aside, and treating caregivers like a burden. i’ve seen elderly patients, some too weak to stand, being forced to wait in lines for hours while hospital staff act as if they don’t exist.

we are exhausted—mentally, physically, and emotionally. instead of focusing on supporting my mom through this painful treatment, most of my energy is spent navigating a system that is designed to make things harder.

💰 looking for any possible financial help

each chemo cycle costs ₹1.3 lakh, and we still have six more cycles, one major surgery, one full radiation course, and countless follow-ups ahead.

i am looking for any possible financial help:
	•	are there any ngos, government schemes, or organizations that provide financial assistance for breast cancer treatment?
	•	can i enroll in any health insurance now, even with a pre-existing condition?


🙏 my mom is suffering, and i feel helpless

her chemo side effects are horrible:
	•	severe diarrhea – she can barely keep anything down.
	•	zero taste – everything tastes like nothing, and she doesn’t want to eat.
	•	extreme weakness – she barely has the strength to move.

and this is just the first chemo cycle. we still have six more chemo cycles, one major surgery, one full radiation course, and countless follow-ups ahead.

i don’t know how to make this any easier for her. watching her suffer while feeling completely powerless is the worst feeling in the world.

💔 we pay taxes all our lives, but when we need help, we are left to suffer. where is the justice in this?

any advice, guidance, or any source of financial help just words of encouragement would mean the world to me right now. thank you for reading.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"a significant problem we are overlooking footpaths!! when was the last time we walked on the footpath with confidence in bengaluru? it's always blocked by some obstacles! it's either vehicles, street vendors or shops with their huge signs in the middle of the footpath blocking the path. it's such a major problem yet it's become so accepted that we don't even observe it, even if the footpath is clear we don't walk on it because we just assume something in the front will be blocking the path anyway so let's just walk on the road, there are solutions to this of course but it will obviously affect a lot of people and offend them as well. even in residential neighborhoods the footpaths are treated as part of their property and decorated, raised in some place or just as parking space. i feel we are overlooking this problem and just accepted it but it's a dangerous situation.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"water problem in apartment is creating lots of issues. are you facing water issues? hi all,

we are staying in an apartment near cmrit (aecs layout). 

myself and wife are in it and we have a child. we cannot plan our work properly because we dont know when does water stops. 
i know there was water shortage few months back across bangalore. are we still in the same situation even after these many rains?! 

maid leaves home with uncleaned vessels because of water stoppage. owner claims that he is buying water separately (but never shows the proof). on top of this, we recently came to know that owner asked watchman to stop the water supply for 2 hours daily!!! he asks separate money for water. this month he asked 1500 + rent. 

most of the days, water stops at prime time (7am to 9am). this is very crucial timings. preparing kid to school, etc...... 
and water stops at evening, night (random).

we were the one first asked owner about this issue. he told us to vacate. shocked! we just reported the water issue and explained how we are struggling but we got such response. 

later on, all flatmates reported it to owner and he is responding with same attitude. this apartment has less than 20 house. he made 3 families to vacate already. he gave the notice to 2 other families. they are local and they told they wont vacate. 

my wife doesnt want to vacate because of the child. he gets sick often and we have doctors nearby. so she doesnt want to vacate. we have  no car. 

owner already raised rent twice within a year. very very greedy owner. we all know how bad the housing market is. owner is trying hard to vacate families and bring in bachelors for hefty rent. he told that he has many people in line to move-in. 

my wife told, we can pay the water amount if there are no water supply issues. her point is very valid. who can pay the full price for a broken phone?

question: how bad is the water problem in bangalore now? are you also going through this?",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"do you hate commuting to work? i wish it was actually 9-5 and over that, the dreadful commute which is a waste of time, energy, fuel, and money. not to mention that we're taxed for these pothole infested roads.

as a rider who comes from a peaceful city with low traffic and beautiful roads, this is just pathetic. i feel sorry for my bike - clutch riding all the way, barely hitting 3rd gear. to top it off, we've got people with horrible traffic sense. it's really sad!

reddit,"update 1 (from my previous post about bbmp demanding ₹5k for a dug-up road near rv road) bbmp dug up the road and ended up breaking a pipe with electrical wires right in front of my friend’s house. pipes in front of other houses weren’t damaged.

they’re now asking for ₹4,000 to be paid to a keb person to fix it. the house owner agreed and plans to split the cost among the floors.

question: is this ₹4k charge legit?
if bbmp caused the damage, shouldn’t they handle the repair?

one thing to note: the payment was made via upi, so there’s at least a transaction record. they've not yet asked about the 5k they had demanded earlier.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"indians need to take a good-hard look at their country  i hate to be a negative nancy but i think this needs to be said. indians don’t realize the truth, the ground reality of their country. we have adopted the worst aspects of democracy. our politicians use jingoism, religious and cultural pride, hatred for minorities, and a strongman image to distract us from our problem to vote for them. the media inculcates pride, hatred for minorities, and sensationalism to get views and help politicians win elections. the pelicans have literally taken a leaf out of real fascism. they don’t talk about the real issues facing the ordinary man, hence most indians are completely delusional.

do people realize their water, air, food, and ground is poisonous and polluted? our infrastructure is a complete failure. nothing works and people don’t seem to care. do people realize that we won zero gold medals in olympics despite being the most populated nation and having 50% of our population below 25 years of age? the state of policing and the judiciary. the appalling wealth gap.

hating on minorities has become a full-time career now. no matter how many times diljit says he loves india there will be people who call him a separatist without remorse.

when foreigners or indians complain about the appalling situation in india, there are people who hate on them. it is like a business complaining about bad reviews by the customers. if you don’t want people to complain then fix the issues. 

“oh but what about our culture and traditions?! we may be poor but we so relgious and sanskari!”

culture has deteriorated and spiralling downwards. the youth’s iq, attention span, and ability to follow logic seems to have gone down. there will be comments on social media and videos that say complete nonsense, whataboutism and something completely out of context to win an argument. conspiracy theories and pseudoscience has increased among young people.

don’t believe me, just watch the latest movies like animal and adipurush. listen to the latest songs the youth listens to. in facts what’s indian about the youth anyway? unpopular opinion but the fact is most rich kids prefer talking in english most of the time. the younger generations seem more brainwashed, superstitious, negligent, radicalized, and nihilistic than their parents. they have adopted the worst aspects of both cultures. what i see is a bunch of wanna be americans who are also somehow ultra prideful and backwards (animal + adipurush). **so, we are neither prosperous nor are we as naive and innocent as our previous generations before.** 

most people and youth just want to make a quick buck and don’t care how the country is doing or how their actions affect india in the long term. it’s the “jugad” mentality; there’s no perfectionism in the work; everything is half@$$ed. we work hard only until we get a comfortable govt. job then it’s smooth sailing from then on.

what was needed was an embrace of new idea, technology, science and modernity to change with the times. instead we have people clinging to old, millennia old, traditions and trying to justify them through pseudoscience. people wanting to “go back” as far as possible. it’s dangerous and a waste of time.

no matter how much the media would like you to believe, our perception around the world has not improved. i live in north america since 2012 and, long story short, before they did not know about us and now there are all kinds of negative stereotypes about us. this “our reputation has improved” because of ambani’s wedding or whatever other reason is simply propaganda.  

look at other counties who have gone from poor to rich. look at china and singapore, can’t we learn from them? 

i know there will be people who don’t agree with me and will writing long replies. the thing is, this isn’t so much an opinion but something you can see yourself if you are not delusional. we have picked up being argumentative for no reason from the news channel debates we see on tv.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"jiomart is scam. don’t fall for the “no fees” bs. seriously, i'm beyond frustrated with jiomart.

i've been giving them the benefit of the doubt for months, ordering groceries repeatedly, but it's just gotten worse. their whole ""no hidden fees, no delivery fees"" thing? a complete and utter lie.
here's the rundown of my jiomart hell:

• rotten produce and expired goods: it's clear they're just dumping near-expiry stock from reliance smart points. everything is wilted, bruised, or about to expire. i'm basically paying for garbage.

• phantom deliveries and missing items:
half my orders are missing items, and they just mark them as ""returned"" without telling me. no refund, no explanation. just gone.

• non-existent inventory: forget anything remotely fancy. even basic stuff like capsicum and brinjal are constantly out of stock. what's the point of an online grocery service if you can't even get the basics?

• the ""no fees"" lie: the hidden fee is the time and money wasted on dealing with their terrible service and inedible products.

• customer service is a joke: trying to get help from them is like pulling teeth. they just ignore emails and complaints.

i've finally given up and switched to blinkit and zepto. yeah, they charge a small fee, but at least i get fresh groceries and reliable 
deliveries. the difference is night and day.

seriously, avoid jiomart like the plague. you're better off going to the store yourself.

tl;dr: jiomart is a scam. they sell expired food, mess up orders, and their ""no fees"" promise is a joke. just use blinkit or zepto.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"moving to banglore from mumbai update - thank you so much guys for the overwhelming response, this gave me a great idea about the bangalore and how people are there….i had so many double thoughts while posting this, now i feel i can definitely adjust there….i don’t see much of a problem coming from a tier 2/3 city i adjusted in mumbai in 6-8 months so i believe banglore won’t take long for me…..once again thank you so much for all the response…i didn’t expect so many people responding….i have literally read each and every response and found it helpful…




what should i keep in mind in terms of dos and don’ts as exceptions?

is water shortage a really serious issue if u am willing to live in decent well maintained society near marathahalli (my office is near that and i want to minimise travel to 10-15 min)?

language related violence is really very common or they will get irked if you do something or one or two mental cases you can come across in a month ?

correct me if i am wrong - transport is costly as compared to mumbai, food prices are similar, accommodation are cheaper, traffic is more but not that what is exaggerated, difficult to find chapatis and good sabzi (north indian food), cook/maid charges i am not aware (in mumbai i give 4k-5k for one meal, in the posh area

reddit,"the bbmp's 40ft road rule for shops isn't the solution - here's what we should do instead yesterday, bbmp announced they won't renew trade licenses for shops on roads narrower than 40ft in residential areas (established after 2015). while i understand the intention to manage traffic and maintain residential character, i believe this binary approach is problematic and there's a better solution: pedestrianization.

why the current approach is flawed:

1. it's a sledgehammer approach to a nuanced problem. not all sub-40ft streets are the same - some might be perfect for local shops while others aren't.

2. it hurts local businesses that make our neighborhoods more liveable. think of your favorite local bakery or convenience store - they actually reduce car trips by letting people walk to get basic necessities.

3. it's historically been poorly enforced (as noted by i change indiranagar), which means we're just creating more informal/illegal businesses rather than solving the actual problems.

a better solution: pedestrianization with limited vehicle access

instead of banning businesses outright, we should:

1. convert narrow residential streets into pedestrian-priority zones where cars are guests. this is called ""shared space"" design or ""woonerf"" - it's been hugely successful in cities from amsterdam to tokyo.

2. allow local businesses but with strict guidelines on delivery timing, waste management, and noise levels. this maintains the residential character while preserving useful amenities.

3. use design elements like traffic calming such as different paving, planters, and street furniture to naturally slow traffic and make the space more people-friendly.

real-world examples we can learn from:
- church street's pedestrianization experiment is showing great results
- commercial street's partial pedestrianization

instead of killing our neighborhood shops with blanket bans, let's create streets that work for everyone. while bbmp remains fixated on maximizing vehicle throughput, cities worldwide have proven that prioritizing people over cars creates more vibrant, liveable neighborhoods. bengaluru deserves better than outdated car-centric planning.

i have been saying this repeatedly - let’s start sending emails and letters to our respective mlas and mps to pressure them to apply pressure on the government in the state assembly and parliament.

reddit,"frustrated: power cuts why if we're living in a city like bangalore we have constant power cuts like a village! it's understandable when its in the summer when power draw is fairly high but now in the winter or even when it slightly rains, poof, gone. especially in rajajinagar. literally can't get any work done.

before some of you ask me to go back to where i came from, i am a kannadiga and i've spent my entire life here. i love this city, but the power cuts are just too frustrating.",PseudoTopic_0

reddit,"why are roads in mumbai fixed in patches? almost everywhere i go in mumbai, the roads are never at the same level. there are patches of tar which are a few millimeters above the standard level of the roads.

why - despite mumbai being the city generating the highest gdp of the entire country has such a deplorable state of ""fixed"" roads? to clarify, i'm **not** talking about the monsoon condition of roads nor the potholes. i'm concerned about the the roads that have been fixed are always fixed in rectangular patches.

i have had business associates from uk, europe asking me this same thing. if such shabby level of work is done for fixing roads, how can mumbai ever be a world class city?",PseudoTopic_0
